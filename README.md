# DMPKBench

This repository hosts the dataset and code for constructing DMPKBench, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) and multi-agents in the domain of drug discovery DMPK. DMPKBench covers five core competencies essential to domain experts: experimental design and testing, interpretation of experimental results, ADMET multi-parameter optimization, pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation, and inference of drug disposition in the human body. The benchmark comprises a large-scale knowledge base of more than 100,000 questionâ€“answer pairs across multiple modalities, including multi-step quantitative reasoning (e.g. human dose prediction), troubleshooting of real-world DMPK data tables and pharmacokinetic curves, and integrated problem-solving scenarios.

Upon acceptance of the related manuscript, all datasets and source code will be made publicly available here to support reproducibility, benchmarking, and further research in AI for drug discovery.
