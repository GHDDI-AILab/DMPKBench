    "question": "P-glycoprotein substrate liability hindered benzothiazole amidoxime 12b in vivo. Which comparative insight is gained by referencing proteasome inhibitor 7 and acoziborole?",
    "options": [
      "A) High passive permeability and low P-gp affinity facilitate CNS exposure and systemic efficacy",
      "B) Strong P-gp inhibition boosts intracellular accumulation but compromises safety",
      "C) Exclusive renal elimination negates transporter interactions",
      "D) P-gp substrate status correlates with enhanced blood–brain barrier penetration",
      "E) P-gp induction improves oral bioavailability by increasing intestinal absorption",
      "F) P-gp binding is irrelevant when enterohepatic recirculation dominates clearance"

    "question": "Enterohepatic recirculation affected acoziborole pharmacokinetics, but activated charcoal had minimal impact at doses above 20 mg. Which comparative inference arises when this is contrasted with indole-2-carboxamide exposure and pyridyl-thiazole failures?",
    "options": [
      "A) Long systemic half-life through recirculation can mask low intrinsic clearance and still permit single-dose regimens",
