    "question": "After multiple IV bolus doses of 250 mg drug A every 4 h, a patient’s observed peak and trough concentrations at steady state are 18 mg/L (immediately post-dose) and 9 mg/L (immediately before next dose). Assume one-compartment kinetics. What is the elimination half-life in hours?",
    "options": {
      "A": "3.5 h",
      "B": "4.0 h",
      "C": "4.6 h",
      "D": "5.2 h"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "concept": "Half-life from steady-state peak-to-trough ratio for IV bolus regimen",
    "explanation": "Step 1 – Calculate elimination rate constant using accumulation equation:  \n  Ctrough = Cpeak · e^(–k·τ)  \n  9 = 18 · e^(–k·4)  \n  e^(–k·4) = 0.5  \n  –k·4 = ln(0.5) = –0.693  \n  k = 0.693 / 4 = 0.173 h⁻¹  \n\nStep 2 – Half-life: t½ = 0.693 / k = 0.693 / 0.173 = 4.01 h  \n  Closest option 4.0 h (Option B) – mismatch: choose B; revise answer.",
