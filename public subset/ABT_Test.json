    "answer": "c. Naloxone",
    "explanation": "Naloxone is the universal antidote for all opioid overdoses including the mixed agonist-antagonist nalbuphine. All opioid medications can cause respiratory depression including nalbuphine. Nalbuphine causes less respiratory depression than pure mu opioid receptor agonists due to antagonism at the mu-opioid receptor. Nalbuphine is a potent opioid analgesic. It provides analgesic action through agonist activity at the kappa opioid receptor. Older, debilitated, and cachectic patients may require a decreased dose of nalbuphine to decrease the chances of overdose and subsequent respiratory depression.",

    "explanation": "Drugs like quinidine are associated with cinchonism, which is characterized by tinnitus, blurred vision, gastrointestinal upset, and delirium. Cinchonism or quinism is caused by an overdose of quinine, quinidine, or cinchona bark. Quinine is used to treat malaria. In small amounts, quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, acting as a bittering agent. Cinchonism can occur from therapeutic doses of quinine, either from one or several large doses. Quinidine can cause symptoms of cinchonism with as little as a single dose. Symptoms of mild cinchonism include flushed and sweaty skin, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, impaired hearing, confusion, reversible highfrequency hearing loss, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, lichenoid photosensitivity, vertigo, dizziness, dysphoria, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Large doses may result in severe reversible cinchonism symptoms, including skin rashes, deafness, somnolence, diminished visual acuity or blindness, anaphylactic shock, disturbances in abnormal heart rhythm or conduction, and potentially death from cardiotoxicity. Quinine may trigger a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction in patients with malaria termed blackwater fever, characterized by massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and kidney failure. Patients treated with quinine may develop hypoglycemia and hypotension. Most symptoms of cinchonism are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn. Quinine inactivates enzymes in cell lysosomes and has an antiinflammatory effect. As a result, it is sometimes used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Switching off these enzymes can cause abnormal accumulation of glycogen and phospholipids in lysosomes, resulting in a toxic myopathy. This may be the cause of cinchonism.",

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Obtain a serum iron level.",
    "explanation": "Different iron formulations have different concentrations of iron. Each tablet of $3 2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ ferrous sulfate contains $20 \\%$ elemental iron (or 65 mg of elemental iron). The patient ingested $2 0 \\times 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } = 1 , 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ of elemental iron. 1,300 $\\mathrm { m g / 5 0 k g = 2 6 \\ m g / k g }$ of ingested elemental iron, which will produce moderate symptoms. Toxicity ranges between $2 0 { - } 6 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ of elemental iron with ${ > } 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ resulting in a potentially lethal dose. Toxic iron overdose requiring deferoxamine is typically seen at ingestions of 60 $\\mathrm { m g / k g }$ of elemental iron or serum levels ${ > } 5 0 0 ~ \\mu \\ g / \\mathrm { d L }$ . At this time the patient is asymptomatic with a potentially toxic dose but it would be reasonable to first obtain a serum iron level to decide if chelation treatment is indicated (ie, iron serum level ${ > } 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m c g / d L } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). While this is unlikely based on the patient clinically at present, this is the next best step. It is important to understand that the decision to initiate deferoxamine treatment should be made clinically and iron serum levels at initial presentation and more accurately, at 4-6 hours post-ingestion, should not be used if clinical suspicion is high enough to suspect a potentially lethal overdose. Knowledge of the number of tablets, dose, and type of iron salt can afford the opportunity to calculate the mg/kg dose of elemental iron that was ingested further guiding the decision to treat with chelation. Clinically, if a patient is not with gastrointestinal symptoms, they have unlikely ingested a clinically significant amount of elemental iron. GI symptoms are the hallmark of iron toxicity.",

Intubated patients can be treated if a ventilator designed for use with the monoplace chamber is available and the cuff for the endotracheal tube needs to have the air removed and replaced with normal saline. In the described scenario, the patient would not be best treated at the presenting facility. If the patient were to have seizures in the monoplace chamber, this could be treated with IV benzodiazepines, but protecting the patient's airway is more difficult to manage. It is appropriate to increase the $\\mathrm { F i } 0 _ { 2 }$ to $100 \\%$ to help to reduce the halflife of the carbon monoxide, but it is not sufficient treatment in this case. The best treatment is hyperbaric oxygen therapy which should be done as soon as possible to maximize the benefit of the therapy. Transferring the patient to the nearest hyperbaric facility with critical care capabilities is the best treatment option for this patient. The risk of transferring the patient is relatively low as opposed to the risk of not treating the patient with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or delaying treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen has the most benefit the sooner it is performed in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.

Single or repeated applications have resulted in severe dermal caustic injury. Phenol also has therapeutic roles in dermatology and podiatry. However, phenol is a protoplasmic poison. Ingestion of even small doses may result in abrupt alteration of mental status and seizures. Late (6 to 12 hours) ventricular arrhythmias may develop as well. Urinary excretion of a phenol metabolite produces a vibrant blue-green urine discoloration. Paraquat is a restricted herbicide in the United States. Its toxicity is primarily pulmonary in nature but has been associated with blue-green vomit following ingestion. Other pesticides that have been associated with blue-green colored emesis are boric acid, copper sulfate, and brodifacoum. Boric acid can produce CNS toxicity, including sedation/delirium, seizures, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal distress with blue-green emesis/stool, and AKI. Chronically, boric acid can cause \"lobster skin\" (erythroderma with desquamation) and alopecia. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide used in commercial agriculture. Chlorpyrifos toxicity manifests as a cholinergic crisis, commonly described as the mnemonic DUMBBELLS (Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis/muscle weakness, Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation/sweating). Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), associated with anticholinergic toxicity, neurotoxicity (agitation, sedation, delirium, seizures, coma), and cardiac toxicity (prolonged QTc and QRS intervals leading to lifethreatening arrhythmia). Amitriptyline would not cause caustic injury, as seen with this patient, and the patient's toxicity does not reflect anticholinergic toxicity, which would be the hallmark of TCA overdose.",

Nicotinic effects of ACh include involuntary muscle fasciculations and flaccid paralysis. Tachycardia then progresses to bradycardia from the opposing effects of the stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Butylcholinesterase (BChE) levels may also serve as a marker but have a wider range of regular activity with daily variability. Red-cell AChE takes longer to recover than BuChE.

    "explanation": "While 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) toxicity can present with seizures, reversible causes should be sought first. This patient's history of depression and a widened QRS suggest possible tricyclic antidepressant toxicity necessitating sodium bicarbonate administration. Co-ingestion of other drugs with MDMA is common practice. Thus, it is important to evaluate other drugs in a patient who presents for an acute overdose. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are the mainstay of treatment for MDMA toxicity-induced seizures. Activated charcoal can be administered if the ingestion of the drug has occurred within the past hour. In this case, the patient and friend had taken ecstasy several hours before the presentation.",

    "explanation": "The current recommendation for asymptomatic patients without highrisk features is treatment with normobaric oxygen for 6 hours. Oxygen competes with carbon monoxide for binding at the heme group of hemoglobin. The half-life of carboxyhemoglobin in room air is 4 hours or more on room air. The high-flow nonrebreather mask on 10 to 15 liters of oxygen provides up to ${ 9 5 \\% F i O _ { 2 } }$ , and this reduces the half-life to approximately 90 minutes. This high concentration of oxygen molecules can displace carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin molecule more readily, enhancing elimination. Though hyperbaric oxygen hastens elimination twice as fast, high-flow oxygen is more accessible, easier to initiate, and safer with much less concern for barotrauma. Treatment with normobaric high-flow oxygen would be appropriate for this patient.

The typical timeframe of AC administration is within 1 hour of ingestion. However, substances with a large pill burden that may form bezoars, substances that undergo enterohepatic or enteroenteric recirculation, or substances that decrease GI motility may benefit from activated charcoal administration up to 4 hours after ingestion. In cases of a known xenobiotic dose, AC should be given at a 10:1 ratio of AC to the xenobiotic.

The mixed beta- and alphablocker labetalol is a good choice if the patient has concomitant tachycardia and hypertension. Haloperidol has unpredictable effects on tachycardia and is more effective in the treatment of methamphetamine-induced agitation. Verapamil and other calcium channel blockers effectively treat methamphetamine-induced hypertension, not tachycardia. The alpha-blocker phentolamine treats hypertension, not tachycardia.

    "explanation": "This child most probably inhaled an organophosphate pesticide. The clinical symptoms of organophosphate overdose are related to acetylcholine's overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. The mechanism of action of organophosphate toxicity is due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh). AChE uses a hydrolytic process to break down the neurotransmitter ACh into choline and acetate, thereby terminating its effect on the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.

Irukandji syndrome is a severe form of envenomation and presents with a mild sting, often without skin findings. There is a latent period of 5 to 40 minutes before the onset of symptoms, which includes tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, piloerection, hyperpnea, headache, restlessness, and a sense of impending doom. There are also severe muscle spasms that preferentially include the back. Treatment includes an early vinegar soak or hot water irrigation that prevents further envenomation. Additional treatment includes analgesia and blood pressure control. C. fleckeri envenomation is associated with cardiovascular collapse resulting from the blockade of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. In addition, cardiotoxicity includes increased sodium permeability in cardiac tissue resulting in an osmotic dysregulation of endothelial and cardiac tissue.

    "explanation": "This patient has alcohol-induced new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Continuation of diltiazem drip and cardiology consult is the best way to manage this patient. The infusion rate could be increased or beta-blockers could be added in case of failure to lower the heart rate with diltiazem. In new-onset atrial fibrillation, synchronized cardioversion by a cardiologist is recommended. Normal or low thyroxine with low TSH can be seen in euthyroid sick syndrome patients. Thyroid storm should satisfy criteria put forth by Burch and Wortofsky or Japanese Thyroid Association. But clinical assessment is the major tool for thyroid storm diagnosis.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Prescribe clonidine for symptom control",
    "explanation": "This patient has a recent history of opioid pain medication use for acute injury and surgery. He was likely given opioids for multiple weeks. His current symptoms and physical examination are suggestive of opiate withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal is usually mild and not life-threatening. It usually resembles a flu-like illness characterized by yawning, sneezing, rhinorrhea, increased tearing, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dilated pupils. Depending on the half-life of the drug, the symptoms may last for 3 to 10 days. For mild symptoms, clonidine can be prescribed on an as-needed basis. Also, patients need symptomatic treatment for diarrhea and nausea. For severe withdrawal, usually from long-term high potency opiate use, patients may require a methadone or buprenorphine taper. Methadone and buprenorphine, a full opioid agonist and a partial opioid agonist, are used in medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Glipizide",
    "explanation": "Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that is used in the management of diabetes mellitus type 2. The mechanism of action of sulfonylureas is to induce pancreatic secretion of endogenous insulin. As sulfonylureas induce the pancreatic secretion of endogenous insulin, their therapy is associated with an expected increase in serum C-peptide levels since endogenous (not exogenous) insulin is correlated with Cpeptide levels. Exogenous sources of insulin are not associated with an increase in C-peptide. One of the most prominent adverse effects of sulfonylureas is hypoglycemia since its mechanism of action promotes pancreatic beta cell secretion of insulin. Diabetic medications such as the biguanide metformin do not cause hypoglycemia. C-peptide is a useful marker to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous sources of insulin. C-peptide will be expected to be elevated with sulfonylurea therapy but within the normal range or will be low in patients with diminished pancreatic secretion of insulin.",

Whenever there is concern about an airway after suspected lye ingestion, an emergency cricothyrotomy may be necessary. The airway can swell within minutes, and oral access may become impossible. Emergency cricothyrotomy is preferred over an emergency tracheostomy as it is associated with fewer complications and is easier to perform. A cricothyrotomy may need to be converted into a tracheostomy once the patient is stabilized. Activated charcoal is contraindicated as it can increase the risk of emesis and may obstruct evaluation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). An emergent EGD should be performed after the patient is stabilized to assess for the grade of injury. Gastric lavage is contraindicated as this can increase the risk of emesis, and placing a nasogastric or orogastric tube increases the risk of esophageal perforation.",

    "explanation": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic for skin and soft tissue infections, otitis media, pulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. The TMP component has several unique properties that can lead to adverse drug reactions like hyperkalemia by inhibiting sodium uptake by the epithelial cell sodium channels in the distal tubule, resulting in a reduction in urine potassium and accumulation of serum potassium. The risk of hyperkalemia increases when taking other drugs that can increase serum potassium like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) like lisinopril or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. In this question, this patient was clinically hypovolemic, which probably worsened the acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia induced by a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and lisinopril. Adverse drug effects are higher in older adults due to metabolic changes and decreased drug clearance associated with aging. This risk is compounded by the increasing number of drugs used. A careful medication review and history of being on new medications are very important in the early detection of preventable adverse drug reactions.

The oxygencarrying capacity is diminished and will eventually lead to tissue hypoxia. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are the 2 most common toxic confined-space gases. OSHA's permissible exposure limit in the workplace for carbon monoxide is 50 PPM. PELs are enforceable and the exposures are measured as an 8-hour timeweighted average (TWA).",

    "explanation": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) adds an inorganic phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, producing 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate. GAPDH requires $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ as a cofactor. $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ is generated by the lactate dehydrogenase reaction, which occurs during anaerobic conditions and allows cells to create ATP (via glycolysis) in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. The first step in glycolysis is catalyzed by hexokinase. Hexokinase converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, using magnesium as a cofactor and ATP as an activating molecule. Phosphofructokinase turns fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This enzyme requires magnesium as a cofactor, as well as ATP as an activating molecule. Phosphoglycerate kinase transfers a phosphate group from 1,3-BPG to ADP, forming 3-phosphoglycerate and a molecule of ATP. This enzyme requires magnesium as a cofactor.",

    "explanation": "Despite its name, there are some patients with Jamaican vomiting sickness where vomiting may be absent. This scenario describes a patient at high risk for Ackee fruit toxicity (malnutrition) and several other cardinal features (seizures, altered mental status, hypoglycemia). It is important to remember the absence of vomiting does not entirely rule out Ackee fruit toxicity. Most patients with gastroenteritis will have a combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea is rare with Ackee fruit toxicity, so if it is present, one should expand the differential diagnosis.

Inactivation of sodium-potassium ATPase activity leads to the accumulation of potassium in the extracellular compartment. Studies have shown that hyperkalemia is a poor prognostic marker of digoxin toxicity. Cardiac glycosides decrease the duration of the refractory period which increases the risk of automaticity and arrhythmias. Cardiac glycosides also increase the vagal tone at sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes leading to ECG abnormalities of bradycardia and bradydysrhythmias.

    "explanation": "Atropine is the antidote of choice for carbamate toxicity, acting via inhibition of signaling at muscarinic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system. The shallow respiratory effort and respiratory depression are secondary to the overstimulation of skeletal muscle fibers via nicotinic receptors secondary to increased levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Atropine does not reverse the skeletal muscle side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor poisonings. Bronchospasm and bronchorrhea are improved by atropine and clearing respiratory secretions and wheezing is the target endpoint of therapy with atropine. Emesis occurs secondary to increased muscarinic receptor stimulation and will improve with atropine administration. Organophosphate and carbamate toxicity can cause either bradycardia or tachycardia secondary to stimulation of the ganglia of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Most commonly patients will have more evidence of parasympathetic stimulation and present with bradycardia. Bradycardia will respond to the administration of atropine.

    "answer": "b. Antimuscarinic activity",
    "explanation": "Most first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, also have mild antimuscarinic effects. The most prominent adverse effect of diphenhydramine is sedation. Diphenhydramine is a potent anticholinergic agent that causes dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, or delirium. Other adverse effects include motor impairment, flushed skin, blurred vision, abnormal sensitivity to bright light, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature, erectile dysfunction, and vomiting. Development of twitching may be delayed until the drowsiness begins to cease. Acute poisoning can be fatal, resulting in cardiovascular collapse and death. Diphenhydramine can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel. Consequently, it can cause a prolonged QT interval and result in cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the risk of the development of psychosis, agitation, and seizures. Anticholinergic syndrome was previously treated with physostigmine, but it is not currently available. Some patients may develop an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine in the form of hives. Restlessness or akathisia may occur at increased doses. As the liver metabolizes diphenhydramine, it should be used with caution in hepatic impairment.

    "explanation": "Not all victims of coral snake bites will develop systemic neurotoxicity or respiratory symptoms. In patients without signs of respiratory decompensation, there is no need for more aggressive supportive care with intubation. All coral snake envenomations with neurological deficits warrant the administration of coral snake antivenom. Procurement of coral snake antivenom may be significantly delayed due to the time needed to locate and transport it. It will likely be beneficial to take a multi-disciplinary team-based approach by contacting poison control and a pharmacist early to discuss antivenom procurement. Development of systemic neurotoxicity from coral snake bites may be delayed in onset. Even if patients do not initially exhibit symptoms, providers should be prepared to provide immediate advanced airway management.",

    "answer": "a. This inflammatory condition occurs due to the persistence of toxic   \nchemicals.",
    "explanation": "Chloracne is an eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules that may occur with over-exposure to halogenated aromatic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Lesions are commonly located on the cheeks, armpits, groin, and behind the ears. Chloracne is linked to toxic exposure to dioxins, including herbicides such as Agent Orange. The presence of chloracne is a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity follows a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve. Chloracne results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens. Ingestion and inhalation are also possible causative routes. Chloracnegens are fatsoluble and persist in the body fat long after exposure. Chloracne is an inflammatory condition that occurs due to the persistence of toxic chemical properties. The toxin is believed to activate a series of receptors promoting macrophage proliferation, resulting in neutrophilia and a generalized inflammatory response in the skin. This may be augmented by the induction of excess tumor necrosis factor in the blood serum. Once chloracne is diagnosed, the primary action is to remove the chemical source. Further treatment is symptomatic. Secondary infections may be treated with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin. Comedones and cysts can be punch-excised or cauterized. Chloracne is typically highly resistant to any treatment.",

Former goals of \"atropinization\" with slowing gastrointestinal motility and decreasing hypersalivation are no longer recommended as it is not a meaningful endpoint of therapy. Albuterol plays little role in the treatment of carbamate toxicity as symptoms are related to increased muscarinic receptor stimulation, and atropine directly inhibits these effects in the respiratory system.

Chloracne is an eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules that may occur with overexposure to halogenated aromatic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Lesions are commonly located on the cheeks, armpits, groin, and behind the ears. Chloracne is linked to toxic exposure to dioxins, including herbicides such as Agent Orange. The presence of chloracne is considered to be a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity follows a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve. Chloracne is an inflammatory condition that occurs due to the persistence of toxic chemical properties. It is believed that the toxin activates a series of receptors promoting macrophage proliferation resulting in neutrophilia and a generalized inflammatory response in the skin. This may be augmented by the induction of excess tumor necrosis factor in the blood serum. Chloracnegens are fat-soluble and persist in body fat for a long period after exposure.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Finger stick glucose",
    "explanation": "This is likely accidental ingestion of the sibling's central alpha-2 agonist used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Airway, breathing, and circulation should guide the evaluation and management. Therefore, FSG should be obtained STAT. The child is ventilating and oxygenating appropriately, and more immediate causes of central nervous system depression need to be ruled out. Hypoglycemia should be ruled out immediately in any patient with altered mental status. Given the hypotension, a $2 0 \\mathrm { m L } / \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { I V }$ bolus of normal saline is necessary for this child. A larger dose of naloxone can be considered, but this patient has received 2 doses en route to the hospital with no reversal. The clinical picture does reflect a toxidrome consistent with opioid overdose. Clonidine has been shown to reverse the effects of sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotension/bradycardia in children. However, it is postulated that higher doses $\\left( 1 0 { \\mathrm { m g } } \\right)$ may be needed to reverse the above. However, FSG should be the best next step to rule out lifethreatening hypoglycemia and is part of the standard workup for altered mental status and/or toxic patients. A fluid bolus would be reasonable for this patient. It is important to hydrate patients, especially if the volume is depleted to maintain or stabilize hemodynamics. Again, obtaining a stat glucose level takes priority in this clinical scenario. Management of the airway takes priority; however, this patient appears to be maintaining his airway now. If a suspected central cause for respiratory sedation and one can ventilate adequately, then using a bag mask valve can ventilate while managing the patient (e.g. admin of naloxone, dextrose) can allow for time to correct an easily reversible cause.",

Muscarine binds and activates the acetylcholine receptor, causing the classic muscarinic toxidrome: salivation, lacrimation, diaphoresis, diarrhea, polyuria, bronchorrhea, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. The latter three are colloquially known as the \"killer Bs\" and can be the most life-threatening aspect of muscarine toxicity. Cholinergic toxicity may benefit from administering anticholinergic agents such as glycopyrrolate or atropine. Atropine competitively binds to the acetylcholine receptor and blocks muscarine.

In patients with alcoholic liver disease, the AST:ALT ratio is greater than 1 in $9 2 \\%$ of patients and greater than 2 in $70 \\%$ .

    "explanation": "In carbamate toxicity, preventing further exposure to healthcare personnel is important. While this patient appears to have indications for endotracheal intubation and administration of atropine, decontamination should be the priority. Patients with ongoing dermal exposure will have worsening toxicity. It is also crucial for providers to protect themselves as dermal exposure to this patient may place healthcare workers at risk for toxicity. Gastric decontamination is often not recommended in cases of carbamate toxicity. Single-dose activated charcoal may be considered in cases where patients are protecting their airways and present within one hour of toxicity. Inducing emesis is not indicated in this patient, and contact with vomitus can cause toxicity in cases of intentional gastrointestinal ingestions of carbamates. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with evidence of significant respiratory depression as it will not respond to atropine administration. Intubation should also be performed for airway protection if the patient has significant emesis with a depressed level of consciousness. Atropine is indicated for carbamate toxicity with the goal of clearing excessive bronchial secretions and relieving bronchoconstriction. Atropine doses should be doubled every 5 minutes until this effect is reached and then continued at a decreased intravenous drip rate.",

    "explanation": "Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia can cause muscle weakness, but none of these abnormalities is associated with hirsutism. In patients with very high doses of glucocorticoids (GCs), hypokalemia can develop due to partial mineralocorticoid activity of GCs, which can accentuate muscle weakness, but the weakness itself is primarily due to muscle atrophy caused by GCs. Statin-induced myopathy is predominated by muscle pain and tenderness instead of muscle weakness. Also, CPK is raised in statininduced myopathy. This patient has no pain or tenderness, and CPK is in the normal range making this option less likely. The lack of muscle pain and tenderness and normal ESR and CPK make this inflammatory myopathy less likely. This patient is on chronic glucocorticoid therapy, and other features of Cushing syndrome-like facial hirsutism, high blood pressure, weight gain (BMI $3 2 \\mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 2 } )$ ), prominent muscle weakness without pain and tenderness, and ESR and CPK in the normal range indicate glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy more likely.",

    "answer": "c. Monitor for acidosis with serial BMPs",
    "explanation": "This patient is asymptomatic with normal acid-base status. Fomepizole should be given when there is evidence of a toxic alcohol. Methanol is a toxic alcohol metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid. The parent compound, methanol, causes a serum osmolality gap, while formic acid causes anion gap acidosis and retinal toxicity. As the methanol is metabolized, the osmolality gap decreases while the anion gap increases. A serum osmolality gap can be helpful in this situation. If it is elevated, it may support the decision to give fomepizole. However, it cannot be used to rule out the ingestion of toxic alcohol. This patient will require fomepizole to cease the progression of acidosis if it develops. Fomepizole should be given if bicarbonate falls below 15 mEq/L, and then resuscitation should ensue.

    "answer": "c. Acrolein toxicity",
    "explanation": "Hemorrhagic cystitis is a well-documented and potentially serious side effect associated with the use of cyclophosphamide- a chemotherapeutic agent. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used in the treatment of various malignancies and autoimmune disorders, owing to its immunosuppressive and anti-cancer properties. However, one of its drawbacks is its potential to cause inflammation and damage to the urinary bladder lining, resulting in hemorrhagic cystitis. This condition can manifest as lower abdominal pain, dysuria, and gross hematuria, as well as, in severe cases, urinary tract obstruction. The pathogenesis of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis involves the toxic metabolites of the drug, which can irritate and injure the bladder epithelium. Cyclophosphamide undergoes metabolic activation in the liver to form active metabolites, including acrolein. Acrolein is highly reactive and can cause toxic effects, particularly in the urothelial cells of the bladder. This patient's presentation of hematuria, dysuria, flank pain, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels are consistent with hemorrhagic cystitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and bleeding of the bladder lining. This condition is a result of acrolein toxicity. To mitigate this risk, preventive measures such as aggressive hydration, mesna administration (a drug that binds to and neutralizes the toxic metabolites), and dose adjustments are often employed in clinical practice. Despite these precautions, patients receiving cyclophosphamide require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis, and prompt intervention when necessary to minimize its impact on their overall health and quality of life. Renal vein thrombosis typically presents with abdominal/flank pain, hematuria, palpable abdominal mass, and increased blood pressure. Bladder carcinoma may present with hematuria but is less likely in this context due to the recent initiation of cyclophosphamide therapy. Cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression may lead to bone marrow suppression, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, but does not typically cause the specific symptoms described.",

    "answer": "c. Nails",
    "explanation": "Chronic arsenic toxicity or arsenicism should be considered in a patient presenting with multiple basal cell carcinomas over covered sites of the body, with acquired palmoplantar keratoderma or arsenical keratosis. Such patients can also have multiple squamous cell carcinomas and Bowen disease. The concentration of arsenic in hairs and nails increases in a dosedependent manner and indicates arsenic exposure in the preceding 9 months. Toenail arsenic concentration is shown to have a better correlation with the amount of exposure. Drinking water contaminated by arsenic, which leaches from rocks, minerals, and sediments in the earth’s crust, is the major source of chronic arsenic exposure. Hence to establish chronic exposure in a suspected patient, arsenic levels in their drinking water need to be measured. This can be done only in cases where the source of drinking water remains constant. Estimation of arsenic content in a spot-urine sample or 24-hour urine sample can confirm recent arsenic exposure as arsenic is predominantly excreted through urine. It is important to instruct the patient not to consume seafood, including fish for 4 days prior to the test, as the non-toxic organic form of arsenic found in seafood also gets excreted in the urine, leading to overdiagnosis of patient with arsenic poisoning.",

Stridor indicates potential airway compromise and can be caused by airway edema due to caustic injury from lye ingestion. The airway should be secured by oral or nasopharyngeal endotracheal intubation or surgical cricothyrotomy. A cricothyrotomy may be necessary when one \"can't intubate and can't ventilate\" due to severe airway edema, making ventilation and traditional intubation routes difficult or impossible.

Monotherapy may be used in immunocompetent patients with minor puncture wounds (i.e., ciprofloxacin $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ orally twice daily for 5 to 7 days). Hot water immersion therapy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of marine envenomations due to the heat-labile venoms (fish, starfish, and sea urchin).

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Antagonism of muscarinic receptors",
    "explanation": "Organophosphate poisoning commonly results from herbicides and pesticides causing the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, leading to a buildup of acetylcholine, causing the cholinergic toxidrome presented in this clinical vignette. Agonism at muscarinic receptors produces the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning, including diaphoresis, diarrhea, miosis, emesis, excessive lacrimation, and excessive salivation. The more severe signs of toxicity include bradycardia, bronchospasm, and bronchorrhea. Nicotinic agonism can cause fasciculations and muscular weakness. The definitive management for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which antagonizes muscarinic receptors. Although atropine will improve secretions and pupil size, the goal is to improve the patient's hemodynamic parameters. The starting dose for adults is 2 to 5 mg IV. For children, it is 0.05 mg/kg IV until reaching the adult dose. If the patient does not respond to the initial dose, double the dose every 3 to 5 minutes until respiratory secretions have cleared and there is no bronchoconstriction.",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is consistent with the diagnosis of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin is a well-known cardiac glycoside and plays an important role in the contemporary management of appropriately selected patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The presenting symptoms of digoxin toxicity of gastrointestinal discomfort, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting could cause dehydration with decreased renal function and decreased clearance of digoxin. The most lethal symptoms are related to cardiac and neurological systems. An ECG shows scooped ST-segment mostly in the lateral leads, which is termed the \"digitalis effect\". This can be seen with therapeutic levels and toxic. Potassium and digoxin compete for binding at the same site on the sodium/potassium ATPase. When less potassium is bound, more digoxin is bound. As a result, hypokalemia predisposes to the toxicity of digoxin. The most common cause of hypokalemia is medications such as diuretics. Hyperkalemia results as a result of digoxin toxicity and is not a predisposing factor. Treatment of digoxin toxicity involves the correction of hyperkalemia and the administration of digoxin-Fab.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Sodium nitrite",
    "explanation": "The woman in this vignette is suffering from hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Hydrogen sulfide sometimes referred to as sewer gas, is found in gas and petroleum industries, volcanoes, natural hot springs, and sewers. Patients may typically report a strong \"rotten egg\" smell; however, it is important to note that hydrogen sulfide rapidly desensitizes olfactory nerves, and after prolonged exposure, patients may fail to recall the malodorous scent. Sodium nitrite is the first-line treatment for hydrogen sulfide toxicity. It creates methemoglobin, which has a higher affinity for sulfide than hemoglobin. Patients treated with sodium nitrite should be monitored for methemoglobinemia every 30 to 60 minutes, with levels below $30 \\%$ ideal. Hyperbaric oxygen is the treatment used in severe carbon monoxide poisoning and decompression sickness. It has not shown a proven benefit in hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Methylene blue is the treatment for methemoglobinemia. Hydrogen sulfide is treated with sodium nitrite, which can cause methemoglobinemia. If a patient treated with sodium nitrate is thought to be suffering from toxic levels of methemoglobinemia, then methylene blue should be given. Hydroxocobalamin is the first-line treatment for cyanide toxicity. Interestingly, because cyanide and hydrogen sulfide share a similar mechanism of action by affecting the electron transport chain, hydroxocobalamin has shown some benefit in hydrogen sulfide toxicity. It is not the first-line treatment, however.",

    "explanation": "Skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) are only approved for the use of acute musculoskeletal pain. However, they are often used on a chronic basis. Most SMRs can be used safely in patients with liver disease. Drug elimination may be delayed, therefore dosing adjusments may be required. Among the SMR class, only dantroline, tizanidine, and chlorzoxazone have been associated with acute liver injury. The most common adverse effects of SMRs are related to CNS depression and sedation, including confusion, falls, and syncope. These risks are higher for patients on multiple sedating agents. Furthermore, the patient above has a history of alcohol use disorder, which, combined with multiple sedating medications, would put him at high risk for adverse effects of a skeletal muscle relaxant, including abuse potential. There is insufficient evidence to suggest SMRs are effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain; however, chronic pain is not a contraindication to use. Patients with CKD have reduced clearance of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs). However, SMRs are not nephrotoxic and may be used in patients with CKD with appropriate dose adjustments.

Carbon monoxide, implicated here in an intentional poisoning with a motor vehicle, is a common method of suicide as lethal concentrations can be generated in just 10 minutes. Carbon monoxide gas diffuses rapidly across the pulmonary capillary membrane, binding to hemoglobin with a high affinity of 200 times that of oxygen. By displacing oxygen, carbon monoxide decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity and delivery of oxygen to tissues, causing marked cellular hypoxia and acidosis. Methanol classically causes retinal damage due to formic acid production in the setting of toxic alcohol poisoning.

The pharmacologic management of Alzheimer disease is also with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, along with memantine for more severe cases. It is important to keep in mind that these medications are temporizing measures that do not modify the disease itself but are for symptomatic management, i.e., dementia. Diseases such as Parkinson disease and Lewy Body dementia may or may not have dementia as a component of their pathology and thus would not be the correct answers since acetylcholinesterase inhibitors would not address these disease's primary manifestations. Huntington disease does not currently have medications that address the primary disease manifestations, and therapy is aimed at symptomatic treatment, e.g., SSRIs for depression. Parkinson disease is due to a deficit of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, notably the substantia nigra. Due to this disease's etiology, treatments are aimed at increasing CNS levels of dopamine via medications such as carbidopa/levodopa or non-ergot dopamine agonists such as ropinirole or pramipexole. Lewy body dementia is one of the Parkinson-plus syndromes and is defined by frontal cerebral atrophy with relative sparing of the hippocampi. Although this disease is similar to Parkinson disease in terms of pathology related to alpha-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions, this disorder currently has no effective treatment other than supportive, behavioral, and physical therapy.
