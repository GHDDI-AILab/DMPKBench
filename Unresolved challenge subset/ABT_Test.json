        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Activated charcoal (AC) can absorb certain nonpolar toxic materials in the liquid phase within the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. The typical timeframe of AC administration is within 1 hour of ingestion. However, substances with a large pill burden that may form bezoars, substances that undergo enterohepatic or enteroenteric recirculation, or substances that decrease GI motility may benefit from activated charcoal administration up to 4 hours after ingestion. In cases of a known xenobiotic dose, AC should be given at a 10:1 ratio of AC to the xenobiotic. In this patient, approximately 8 grams of aspirin was ingested, so 80 grams of activated charcoal is indicated. When the xenobiotic dose is unknown, doses of AC should be given at 1 to 2 grams/kg of body weight. If the amount of aspirin were unknown, it would be reasonable to administer 55 grams of AC to this patient.",

        "explanation": "Metoprolol should be initiated for suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Tachycardia greatly increases myocardial oxygen demand; thus, treating tachycardia is essential as the half-life of methamphetamine may be up to 12 hours. The mixed beta- and alphablocker labetalol is a good choice if the patient has concomitant tachycardia and hypertension. Haloperidol has unpredictable effects on tachycardia and is more effective in the treatment of methamphetamine-induced agitation. Verapamil and other calcium channel blockers effectively treat methamphetamine-induced hypertension, not tachycardia. The alpha-blocker phentolamine treats hypertension, not tachycardia. It is an older, rarely used drug with a long half-life and is not titratable for the treatment of hypertension.",

Methanol is a toxic alcohol metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid. The parent compound, methanol, causes a serum osmolality gap, while formic acid causes anion gap acidosis and retinal toxicity. As the methanol is metabolized, the osmolality gap decreases while the anion gap increases. A serum osmolality gap can be helpful in this situation. If it is elevated, it may support the decision to give fomepizole. However, it cannot be used to rule out the ingestion of toxic alcohol. This patient will require fomepizole to cease the progression of acidosis if it develops. Fomepizole should be given if bicarbonate falls below 15 mEq/L, and then resuscitation should ensue.

        "explanation": "Agricultural fertilizers can contain hexavalent chromium, and farmers can be occupationally exposed through their use, particularly in the absence of personal protective equipment. This patient's symptom association with the growing season points toward occupational exposure. Dermal exposure to hexavalent chromium causes contact dermatitis mediated by a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This causes dry, cracked skin and erythema after repeated exposure and can lead to the development of skin thickening, blisters, ulcers, and eczema. Dermal exposure and skin sensitization also increase the risk for respiratory sensitization and the development of occupational asthma, particularly in an aerosolized form. Additionally, chronic inhalation exposure carries an increased lifetime risk of lung cancer, and abnormal pulmonary function could direct management for further investigation. He also may benefit from fitting for a respirator to use while mixing his fertilizer to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure and always wearing gloves. Skin biopsy and sensitization testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis at later visits, but these are more invasive tests. Systemic steroids may help alleviate symptoms, but this patient is at risk for respiratory symptoms and toxicity and requires further testing.",

Binding increases the duration of chloride channel opening, allowing chloride ions to enter the brain cells and leading to increased negative charges, and altering the voltage in the brain. The change in voltage makes the cells resistant to impulses and thus depresses them. Benzodiazepines act on GABA-A chloride ion channels as well. However, their mechanism of action is to increase the frequency, not duration, of chloride channel opening. Flumazenil is an appropriate treatment for an overdose of benzodiazepine. The toxic dose of barbiturates varies. However, an oral dose of $1 \\mathrm { { g } }$ for most barbiturates can cause significant poisoning in an adult.

Haloperidol and fluphenazine, both first-generation neuroleptic agents, are most commonly associated with NMS. However, NMS can also occur with second-generation or \"atypical\" neuroleptic agents such as risperidone. Risk factors for the development of NMS include high doses of neuroleptic medications, recent or rapid escalation in dosing, a switch from one agent to another, and parenteral administration. The treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is largely supportive and includes maintenance of euvolemia and normothermia as well as prevention of complications, which include deep venous thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In cases of severe muscle rigidity not improved with supportive measures, dantrolene and bromocriptine can be used. The distinguishing feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is the classic \"lead pipe\" rigidity.

Sulfonylureas are one of a few xenobiotics that can cause severe life-threatening toxicity with exposure to just one tablet in small children/infants. Sulfonylureas are a class of anti-diabetic medications used orally for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When ingested alone or in combination with other oral hypoglycemics (e.g. metformin) or insulin, the risk for hypoglycemia increases. Sulfonylureas are especially concerning within the class of oral hypoglycemics due to the propensity to cause hypoglycemia when ingested alone which is less common with other oral hypoglycemics (e.g. metformin) which often become an issue only when combined with other glucose-lowering agents. Further, sulfonylureas are concerning due it's long half-life and duration of toxicity, delayed nature of toxicity, and paradoxical hypoglycemia after administration of sugar products (see below). With a suspected or confirmed sulfonylurea overdose, recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia is critical. Altered mentation, confusion, seizures, diaphoresis, agitation, anxiety, restlessness, lightheadedness, and hallucinations characterize symptoms of hypoglycemia for which one or all may be present. Treatment should first be aimed at raising serum glucose concentrations immediately with either oral glucose or intravenous dextrose if IV has been established. Glucagon can be administered intramuscularly if IV access has not been established or is delayed. Oral glucose is the preferred route to raise serum glucose levels, especially in sulfonylurea overdoses. This is due to the paradoxical nature of persistent hypoglycemia with dextrose administration in the sulfonylurea-toxic patient. Larger boluses of dextrose can cause further hypoglycemia by stimulating more sulfonylurea-induced insulin release in response to larger serum glucose levels. Oral administration of sugar can also cause this paradoxical effect but less frequently as compared to intravenous dextrose. Octreotide is used in cases of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia based on its mechanism of action on islet pancreatic beta cells. Octreotide binds to the sulfonylurea receptor on the ATP-dependent potassium efflux channels. The result of octreotide binding to its receptor results in the closing and therefore termination of potassium ions effluxed to the extracellular space. This results in downstream deactivation of the secondary messenger cAMP and subsequently retarding the release of insulin granules into the bloodstream. Somatostatin can be used in cases of Sulfonylurea induced hypoglycemia; however, octreotide is more specific for its receptor. Glucagon can be used in the initial management of severe hypoglycemia where IV access has not been established for any reason. IV access should eventually be used so that IV dextrose can be used in cases where oral glucose is contraindicated (e.g. unable to protect the airway, aspiration risk). Finally, octreotide IV should be administered in cases of either delayed, rebound, or persistent hypoglycemia.",

        "explanation": "The presentation of a neonate with abdominal distention, cyanosis, and ashen-gray skin discoloration is classic for gray-baby syndrome secondary to either fetal or maternal chloramphenicol use. Gray-baby syndrome occurs because of decreased renal clearance and immature hepatic detoxification by uridine 5'-diphosphateglucuronosyltransferase. Gray-baby syndrome can result in permanent neurologic deficits or death secondary to chloramphenicol's displacement of unconjugated bilirubin from albumin, leading to kernicterus. Management of chloramphenicol toxicity centers primarily around supportive care. The general approach to the ashen-gray hemodynamically unstable neonate starts with aggressive resuscitation and an early call to the pediatric intensive care unit or extracorporeal life support team, as some of these patients may be ideal candidates. These patients should be hemodynamically stabilized, appropriately oxygenated and ventilated, and intubated early. Checking a core temperature is critical, as hypothermia is common in the gray neonate. Aggressive rewarming should be considered. Point-of-care glucose should also be checked, and hypoglycemia should be reversed if present.",

        "explanation": "While hypokalemic metabolic acidosis is a finding in toluene toxicity, it is unlikely that this adolescent patient would have profound laboratory changes after acute exposure hence the unremarkable laboratory values. Toluene is metabolized to hippuric acid by cytochrome p-450 enzymes which spontaneously deprotonates in plasma to hippurate which then ionically binds with ammonium, sodium, or potassium cations and is excreted in urine. Thus, chronic toxicity may be associated with hypokalemia resulting in weakness, spasticity, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications such as rhabdomyolysis. A physical examination should involve all systems as no set of findings exists that are specific to toluene toxicity nor dichotomize acute versus chronic exposure. There has been a progression of stages after acute exposure to toluene described by multiple studies: euphoria followed by excitability, disinhibition, and impulsive behaviors. Continued monitoring with serial labs as well as telemetry via admission to the hospital would be the most appropriate disposition for this patient. While there is no evidence-based pharmacologic agent that can be administered to specifically treat toluene toxicity, symptomatic management and intravenous fluids should be considered.",

The physician called 911 because the patient became somnolent about 3 hours into the process. In the ED, initial laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances. As his condition deteriorated, he required mechanical ventilation and intermittent hemodialysis. Urine studies revealed the presence of an organic acid.

            "d. A low flow rate was most likely used with the dialysis apparatus, resulting in decreased clearance of toxic metabolites."
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "This patient likely suffered from glycol ether (GE) toxicity. Due to their solvent properties, GEs are used in dermal fillers. Inadvertent injection in a superficial vessel can induce severe toxicity. Severity also depends on the type of glycol ether and the amount administered. Acute toxicity produces neurological deficits such as drowsiness and weakness. Metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) produces organic acid metabolites excreted in the urine. Drugs with high solubility, such as GEs, result in a large volume of distribution and therefore are poorly removed by hemodialysis. The removal of a drug by hemodialysis is contingent on molecular weight, the volume of distribution, protein binding capacity, dialysis flow rate, and plasma clearance. Hemodialysis is still paramount in acute management to ameliorate fatal electrolyte imbalances (such as hyperkalemia) and severe acidosis. Supportive care employing intubation and mechanical ventilation is also essential should the patient lose the ability to protect the airway, as in this case. Anaphylaxis to an untested drug is a feasible differential; however, the clinical scenario and physical exam are incongruent with a typical anaphylactic reaction. There was no mention of cutaneous findings (hives, angioedema), gastrointestinal complaints, or cardiovascular compromise (hypotension). This patient’s somnolence likely resulted from neurotoxicity from glycol ether (GE) toxicity. Although neurological symptoms are part of anaphylaxis, they often manifest as altered syncope dizziness. Finally, hemodialysis is not the treatment for anaphylaxis, assuming no concurrent metabolic toxicity exists. Protein binding is an essential component regarding the kinetics of hemodialysis. Specifically, a high protein binding capacity results in lower free drug concentrations. Therefore toxins that exhibit high protein binding are poorly removed by dialysis. In this case, if the toxin in question had low protein binding capacity, it would readily be removed by dialysis, and therefore, its urinary metabolites would decrease in concentration. Flow rate is also essential in drug metabolism from an intrinsic biological perspective and artificially by hemodialysis. A low flow state to the liver and kidneys results in poor metabolism and excretion of drugs and metabolites. Similarly, a low flow state can also result in decreased removal of a toxin by hemodialysis. However, if inadequate dialysis flow were the culprit for the delayed metabolism of the toxin, the improvement in the acidosis and electrolyte imbalances would have also been delayed. Additionally, there was no explicit mention of the type of dialysis flow rate used.",
