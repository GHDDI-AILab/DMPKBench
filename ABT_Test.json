    "answer": "c. Naloxone",
    "explanation": "Naloxone is the universal antidote for all opioid overdoses including the mixed agonist-antagonist nalbuphine. All opioid medications can cause respiratory depression including nalbuphine. Nalbuphine causes less respiratory depression than pure mu opioid receptor agonists due to antagonism at the mu-opioid receptor. Nalbuphine is a potent opioid analgesic. It provides analgesic action through agonist activity at the kappa opioid receptor. Older, debilitated, and cachectic patients may require a decreased dose of nalbuphine to decrease the chances of overdose and subsequent respiratory depression.",

    "explanation": "Drugs like quinidine are associated with cinchonism, which is characterized by tinnitus, blurred vision, gastrointestinal upset, and delirium. Cinchonism or quinism is caused by an overdose of quinine, quinidine, or cinchona bark. Quinine is used to treat malaria. In small amounts, quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, acting as a bittering agent. Cinchonism can occur from therapeutic doses of quinine, either from one or several large doses. Quinidine can cause symptoms of cinchonism with as little as a single dose. Symptoms of mild cinchonism include flushed and sweaty skin, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, impaired hearing, confusion, reversible highfrequency hearing loss, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, lichenoid photosensitivity, vertigo, dizziness, dysphoria, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Large doses may result in severe reversible cinchonism symptoms, including skin rashes, deafness, somnolence, diminished visual acuity or blindness, anaphylactic shock, disturbances in abnormal heart rhythm or conduction, and potentially death from cardiotoxicity. Quinine may trigger a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction in patients with malaria termed blackwater fever, characterized by massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and kidney failure. Patients treated with quinine may develop hypoglycemia and hypotension. Most symptoms of cinchonism are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn. Quinine inactivates enzymes in cell lysosomes and has an antiinflammatory effect. As a result, it is sometimes used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Switching off these enzymes can cause abnormal accumulation of glycogen and phospholipids in lysosomes, resulting in a toxic myopathy. This may be the cause of cinchonism.",

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Obtain a serum iron level.",
    "explanation": "Different iron formulations have different concentrations of iron. Each tablet of $3 2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ ferrous sulfate contains $20 \\%$ elemental iron (or 65 mg of elemental iron). The patient ingested $2 0 \\times 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } = 1 , 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ of elemental iron. 1,300 $\\mathrm { m g / 5 0 k g = 2 6 \\ m g / k g }$ of ingested elemental iron, which will produce moderate symptoms. Toxicity ranges between $2 0 { - } 6 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ of elemental iron with ${ > } 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ resulting in a potentially lethal dose. Toxic iron overdose requiring deferoxamine is typically seen at ingestions of 60 $\\mathrm { m g / k g }$ of elemental iron or serum levels ${ > } 5 0 0 ~ \\mu \\ g / \\mathrm { d L }$ . At this time the patient is asymptomatic with a potentially toxic dose but it would be reasonable to first obtain a serum iron level to decide if chelation treatment is indicated (ie, iron serum level ${ > } 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m c g / d L } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). While this is unlikely based on the patient clinically at present, this is the next best step. It is important to understand that the decision to initiate deferoxamine treatment should be made clinically and iron serum levels at initial presentation and more accurately, at 4-6 hours post-ingestion, should not be used if clinical suspicion is high enough to suspect a potentially lethal overdose. Knowledge of the number of tablets, dose, and type of iron salt can afford the opportunity to calculate the mg/kg dose of elemental iron that was ingested further guiding the decision to treat with chelation. Clinically, if a patient is not with gastrointestinal symptoms, they have unlikely ingested a clinically significant amount of elemental iron. GI symptoms are the hallmark of iron toxicity.",

Intubated patients can be treated if a ventilator designed for use with the monoplace chamber is available and the cuff for the endotracheal tube needs to have the air removed and replaced with normal saline. In the described scenario, the patient would not be best treated at the presenting facility. If the patient were to have seizures in the monoplace chamber, this could be treated with IV benzodiazepines, but protecting the patient's airway is more difficult to manage. It is appropriate to increase the $\\mathrm { F i } 0 _ { 2 }$ to $100 \\%$ to help to reduce the halflife of the carbon monoxide, but it is not sufficient treatment in this case. The best treatment is hyperbaric oxygen therapy which should be done as soon as possible to maximize the benefit of the therapy. Transferring the patient to the nearest hyperbaric facility with critical care capabilities is the best treatment option for this patient. The risk of transferring the patient is relatively low as opposed to the risk of not treating the patient with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or delaying treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen has the most benefit the sooner it is performed in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.

Single or repeated applications have resulted in severe dermal caustic injury. Phenol also has therapeutic roles in dermatology and podiatry. However, phenol is a protoplasmic poison. Ingestion of even small doses may result in abrupt alteration of mental status and seizures. Late (6 to 12 hours) ventricular arrhythmias may develop as well. Urinary excretion of a phenol metabolite produces a vibrant blue-green urine discoloration. Paraquat is a restricted herbicide in the United States. Its toxicity is primarily pulmonary in nature but has been associated with blue-green vomit following ingestion. Other pesticides that have been associated with blue-green colored emesis are boric acid, copper sulfate, and brodifacoum. Boric acid can produce CNS toxicity, including sedation/delirium, seizures, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal distress with blue-green emesis/stool, and AKI. Chronically, boric acid can cause \"lobster skin\" (erythroderma with desquamation) and alopecia. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide used in commercial agriculture. Chlorpyrifos toxicity manifests as a cholinergic crisis, commonly described as the mnemonic DUMBBELLS (Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis/muscle weakness, Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation/sweating). Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), associated with anticholinergic toxicity, neurotoxicity (agitation, sedation, delirium, seizures, coma), and cardiac toxicity (prolonged QTc and QRS intervals leading to lifethreatening arrhythmia). Amitriptyline would not cause caustic injury, as seen with this patient, and the patient's toxicity does not reflect anticholinergic toxicity, which would be the hallmark of TCA overdose.",

Nicotinic effects of ACh include involuntary muscle fasciculations and flaccid paralysis. Tachycardia then progresses to bradycardia from the opposing effects of the stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Butylcholinesterase (BChE) levels may also serve as a marker but have a wider range of regular activity with daily variability. Red-cell AChE takes longer to recover than BuChE.

    "explanation": "While 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) toxicity can present with seizures, reversible causes should be sought first. This patient's history of depression and a widened QRS suggest possible tricyclic antidepressant toxicity necessitating sodium bicarbonate administration. Co-ingestion of other drugs with MDMA is common practice. Thus, it is important to evaluate other drugs in a patient who presents for an acute overdose. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are the mainstay of treatment for MDMA toxicity-induced seizures. Activated charcoal can be administered if the ingestion of the drug has occurred within the past hour. In this case, the patient and friend had taken ecstasy several hours before the presentation.",

    "explanation": "The current recommendation for asymptomatic patients without highrisk features is treatment with normobaric oxygen for 6 hours. Oxygen competes with carbon monoxide for binding at the heme group of hemoglobin. The half-life of carboxyhemoglobin in room air is 4 hours or more on room air. The high-flow nonrebreather mask on 10 to 15 liters of oxygen provides up to ${ 9 5 \\% F i O _ { 2 } }$ , and this reduces the half-life to approximately 90 minutes. This high concentration of oxygen molecules can displace carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin molecule more readily, enhancing elimination. Though hyperbaric oxygen hastens elimination twice as fast, high-flow oxygen is more accessible, easier to initiate, and safer with much less concern for barotrauma. Treatment with normobaric high-flow oxygen would be appropriate for this patient.

The typical timeframe of AC administration is within 1 hour of ingestion. However, substances with a large pill burden that may form bezoars, substances that undergo enterohepatic or enteroenteric recirculation, or substances that decrease GI motility may benefit from activated charcoal administration up to 4 hours after ingestion. In cases of a known xenobiotic dose, AC should be given at a 10:1 ratio of AC to the xenobiotic.

The mixed beta- and alphablocker labetalol is a good choice if the patient has concomitant tachycardia and hypertension. Haloperidol has unpredictable effects on tachycardia and is more effective in the treatment of methamphetamine-induced agitation. Verapamil and other calcium channel blockers effectively treat methamphetamine-induced hypertension, not tachycardia. The alpha-blocker phentolamine treats hypertension, not tachycardia.

    "explanation": "This child most probably inhaled an organophosphate pesticide. The clinical symptoms of organophosphate overdose are related to acetylcholine's overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. The mechanism of action of organophosphate toxicity is due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh). AChE uses a hydrolytic process to break down the neurotransmitter ACh into choline and acetate, thereby terminating its effect on the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.

Irukandji syndrome is a severe form of envenomation and presents with a mild sting, often without skin findings. There is a latent period of 5 to 40 minutes before the onset of symptoms, which includes tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, piloerection, hyperpnea, headache, restlessness, and a sense of impending doom. There are also severe muscle spasms that preferentially include the back. Treatment includes an early vinegar soak or hot water irrigation that prevents further envenomation. Additional treatment includes analgesia and blood pressure control. C. fleckeri envenomation is associated with cardiovascular collapse resulting from the blockade of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. In addition, cardiotoxicity includes increased sodium permeability in cardiac tissue resulting in an osmotic dysregulation of endothelial and cardiac tissue.

    "explanation": "This patient has alcohol-induced new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Continuation of diltiazem drip and cardiology consult is the best way to manage this patient. The infusion rate could be increased or beta-blockers could be added in case of failure to lower the heart rate with diltiazem. In new-onset atrial fibrillation, synchronized cardioversion by a cardiologist is recommended. Normal or low thyroxine with low TSH can be seen in euthyroid sick syndrome patients. Thyroid storm should satisfy criteria put forth by Burch and Wortofsky or Japanese Thyroid Association. But clinical assessment is the major tool for thyroid storm diagnosis.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Prescribe clonidine for symptom control",
    "explanation": "This patient has a recent history of opioid pain medication use for acute injury and surgery. He was likely given opioids for multiple weeks. His current symptoms and physical examination are suggestive of opiate withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal is usually mild and not life-threatening. It usually resembles a flu-like illness characterized by yawning, sneezing, rhinorrhea, increased tearing, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dilated pupils. Depending on the half-life of the drug, the symptoms may last for 3 to 10 days. For mild symptoms, clonidine can be prescribed on an as-needed basis. Also, patients need symptomatic treatment for diarrhea and nausea. For severe withdrawal, usually from long-term high potency opiate use, patients may require a methadone or buprenorphine taper. Methadone and buprenorphine, a full opioid agonist and a partial opioid agonist, are used in medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Glipizide",
    "explanation": "Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that is used in the management of diabetes mellitus type 2. The mechanism of action of sulfonylureas is to induce pancreatic secretion of endogenous insulin. As sulfonylureas induce the pancreatic secretion of endogenous insulin, their therapy is associated with an expected increase in serum C-peptide levels since endogenous (not exogenous) insulin is correlated with Cpeptide levels. Exogenous sources of insulin are not associated with an increase in C-peptide. One of the most prominent adverse effects of sulfonylureas is hypoglycemia since its mechanism of action promotes pancreatic beta cell secretion of insulin. Diabetic medications such as the biguanide metformin do not cause hypoglycemia. C-peptide is a useful marker to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous sources of insulin. C-peptide will be expected to be elevated with sulfonylurea therapy but within the normal range or will be low in patients with diminished pancreatic secretion of insulin.",

Whenever there is concern about an airway after suspected lye ingestion, an emergency cricothyrotomy may be necessary. The airway can swell within minutes, and oral access may become impossible. Emergency cricothyrotomy is preferred over an emergency tracheostomy as it is associated with fewer complications and is easier to perform. A cricothyrotomy may need to be converted into a tracheostomy once the patient is stabilized. Activated charcoal is contraindicated as it can increase the risk of emesis and may obstruct evaluation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). An emergent EGD should be performed after the patient is stabilized to assess for the grade of injury. Gastric lavage is contraindicated as this can increase the risk of emesis, and placing a nasogastric or orogastric tube increases the risk of esophageal perforation.",

    "explanation": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic for skin and soft tissue infections, otitis media, pulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. The TMP component has several unique properties that can lead to adverse drug reactions like hyperkalemia by inhibiting sodium uptake by the epithelial cell sodium channels in the distal tubule, resulting in a reduction in urine potassium and accumulation of serum potassium. The risk of hyperkalemia increases when taking other drugs that can increase serum potassium like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) like lisinopril or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. In this question, this patient was clinically hypovolemic, which probably worsened the acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia induced by a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and lisinopril. Adverse drug effects are higher in older adults due to metabolic changes and decreased drug clearance associated with aging. This risk is compounded by the increasing number of drugs used. A careful medication review and history of being on new medications are very important in the early detection of preventable adverse drug reactions.

The oxygencarrying capacity is diminished and will eventually lead to tissue hypoxia. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are the 2 most common toxic confined-space gases. OSHA's permissible exposure limit in the workplace for carbon monoxide is 50 PPM. PELs are enforceable and the exposures are measured as an 8-hour timeweighted average (TWA).",

    "explanation": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) adds an inorganic phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, producing 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate. GAPDH requires $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ as a cofactor. $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ is generated by the lactate dehydrogenase reaction, which occurs during anaerobic conditions and allows cells to create ATP (via glycolysis) in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. The first step in glycolysis is catalyzed by hexokinase. Hexokinase converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, using magnesium as a cofactor and ATP as an activating molecule. Phosphofructokinase turns fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This enzyme requires magnesium as a cofactor, as well as ATP as an activating molecule. Phosphoglycerate kinase transfers a phosphate group from 1,3-BPG to ADP, forming 3-phosphoglycerate and a molecule of ATP. This enzyme requires magnesium as a cofactor.",

    "explanation": "Despite its name, there are some patients with Jamaican vomiting sickness where vomiting may be absent. This scenario describes a patient at high risk for Ackee fruit toxicity (malnutrition) and several other cardinal features (seizures, altered mental status, hypoglycemia). It is important to remember the absence of vomiting does not entirely rule out Ackee fruit toxicity. Most patients with gastroenteritis will have a combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea is rare with Ackee fruit toxicity, so if it is present, one should expand the differential diagnosis.

Inactivation of sodium-potassium ATPase activity leads to the accumulation of potassium in the extracellular compartment. Studies have shown that hyperkalemia is a poor prognostic marker of digoxin toxicity. Cardiac glycosides decrease the duration of the refractory period which increases the risk of automaticity and arrhythmias. Cardiac glycosides also increase the vagal tone at sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes leading to ECG abnormalities of bradycardia and bradydysrhythmias.

    "explanation": "Atropine is the antidote of choice for carbamate toxicity, acting via inhibition of signaling at muscarinic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system. The shallow respiratory effort and respiratory depression are secondary to the overstimulation of skeletal muscle fibers via nicotinic receptors secondary to increased levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Atropine does not reverse the skeletal muscle side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor poisonings. Bronchospasm and bronchorrhea are improved by atropine and clearing respiratory secretions and wheezing is the target endpoint of therapy with atropine. Emesis occurs secondary to increased muscarinic receptor stimulation and will improve with atropine administration. Organophosphate and carbamate toxicity can cause either bradycardia or tachycardia secondary to stimulation of the ganglia of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Most commonly patients will have more evidence of parasympathetic stimulation and present with bradycardia. Bradycardia will respond to the administration of atropine.

    "answer": "b. Antimuscarinic activity",
    "explanation": "Most first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, also have mild antimuscarinic effects. The most prominent adverse effect of diphenhydramine is sedation. Diphenhydramine is a potent anticholinergic agent that causes dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, or delirium. Other adverse effects include motor impairment, flushed skin, blurred vision, abnormal sensitivity to bright light, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature, erectile dysfunction, and vomiting. Development of twitching may be delayed until the drowsiness begins to cease. Acute poisoning can be fatal, resulting in cardiovascular collapse and death. Diphenhydramine can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel. Consequently, it can cause a prolonged QT interval and result in cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the risk of the development of psychosis, agitation, and seizures. Anticholinergic syndrome was previously treated with physostigmine, but it is not currently available. Some patients may develop an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine in the form of hives. Restlessness or akathisia may occur at increased doses. As the liver metabolizes diphenhydramine, it should be used with caution in hepatic impairment.

    "explanation": "Not all victims of coral snake bites will develop systemic neurotoxicity or respiratory symptoms. In patients without signs of respiratory decompensation, there is no need for more aggressive supportive care with intubation. All coral snake envenomations with neurological deficits warrant the administration of coral snake antivenom. Procurement of coral snake antivenom may be significantly delayed due to the time needed to locate and transport it. It will likely be beneficial to take a multi-disciplinary team-based approach by contacting poison control and a pharmacist early to discuss antivenom procurement. Development of systemic neurotoxicity from coral snake bites may be delayed in onset. Even if patients do not initially exhibit symptoms, providers should be prepared to provide immediate advanced airway management.",

    "answer": "a. This inflammatory condition occurs due to the persistence of toxic   \nchemicals.",
    "explanation": "Chloracne is an eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules that may occur with over-exposure to halogenated aromatic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Lesions are commonly located on the cheeks, armpits, groin, and behind the ears. Chloracne is linked to toxic exposure to dioxins, including herbicides such as Agent Orange. The presence of chloracne is a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity follows a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve. Chloracne results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens. Ingestion and inhalation are also possible causative routes. Chloracnegens are fatsoluble and persist in the body fat long after exposure. Chloracne is an inflammatory condition that occurs due to the persistence of toxic chemical properties. The toxin is believed to activate a series of receptors promoting macrophage proliferation, resulting in neutrophilia and a generalized inflammatory response in the skin. This may be augmented by the induction of excess tumor necrosis factor in the blood serum. Once chloracne is diagnosed, the primary action is to remove the chemical source. Further treatment is symptomatic. Secondary infections may be treated with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin. Comedones and cysts can be punch-excised or cauterized. Chloracne is typically highly resistant to any treatment.",

Former goals of \"atropinization\" with slowing gastrointestinal motility and decreasing hypersalivation are no longer recommended as it is not a meaningful endpoint of therapy. Albuterol plays little role in the treatment of carbamate toxicity as symptoms are related to increased muscarinic receptor stimulation, and atropine directly inhibits these effects in the respiratory system.

Chloracne is an eruption of blackheads, cysts, and pustules that may occur with overexposure to halogenated aromatic compounds, including chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Lesions are commonly located on the cheeks, armpits, groin, and behind the ears. Chloracne is linked to toxic exposure to dioxins, including herbicides such as Agent Orange. The presence of chloracne is considered to be a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity follows a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve. Chloracne is an inflammatory condition that occurs due to the persistence of toxic chemical properties. It is believed that the toxin activates a series of receptors promoting macrophage proliferation resulting in neutrophilia and a generalized inflammatory response in the skin. This may be augmented by the induction of excess tumor necrosis factor in the blood serum. Chloracnegens are fat-soluble and persist in body fat for a long period after exposure.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Finger stick glucose",
    "explanation": "This is likely accidental ingestion of the sibling's central alpha-2 agonist used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Airway, breathing, and circulation should guide the evaluation and management. Therefore, FSG should be obtained STAT. The child is ventilating and oxygenating appropriately, and more immediate causes of central nervous system depression need to be ruled out. Hypoglycemia should be ruled out immediately in any patient with altered mental status. Given the hypotension, a $2 0 \\mathrm { m L } / \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { I V }$ bolus of normal saline is necessary for this child. A larger dose of naloxone can be considered, but this patient has received 2 doses en route to the hospital with no reversal. The clinical picture does reflect a toxidrome consistent with opioid overdose. Clonidine has been shown to reverse the effects of sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotension/bradycardia in children. However, it is postulated that higher doses $\\left( 1 0 { \\mathrm { m g } } \\right)$ may be needed to reverse the above. However, FSG should be the best next step to rule out lifethreatening hypoglycemia and is part of the standard workup for altered mental status and/or toxic patients. A fluid bolus would be reasonable for this patient. It is important to hydrate patients, especially if the volume is depleted to maintain or stabilize hemodynamics. Again, obtaining a stat glucose level takes priority in this clinical scenario. Management of the airway takes priority; however, this patient appears to be maintaining his airway now. If a suspected central cause for respiratory sedation and one can ventilate adequately, then using a bag mask valve can ventilate while managing the patient (e.g. admin of naloxone, dextrose) can allow for time to correct an easily reversible cause.",

Muscarine binds and activates the acetylcholine receptor, causing the classic muscarinic toxidrome: salivation, lacrimation, diaphoresis, diarrhea, polyuria, bronchorrhea, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. The latter three are colloquially known as the \"killer Bs\" and can be the most life-threatening aspect of muscarine toxicity. Cholinergic toxicity may benefit from administering anticholinergic agents such as glycopyrrolate or atropine. Atropine competitively binds to the acetylcholine receptor and blocks muscarine.

In patients with alcoholic liver disease, the AST:ALT ratio is greater than 1 in $9 2 \\%$ of patients and greater than 2 in $70 \\%$ .

    "explanation": "In carbamate toxicity, preventing further exposure to healthcare personnel is important. While this patient appears to have indications for endotracheal intubation and administration of atropine, decontamination should be the priority. Patients with ongoing dermal exposure will have worsening toxicity. It is also crucial for providers to protect themselves as dermal exposure to this patient may place healthcare workers at risk for toxicity. Gastric decontamination is often not recommended in cases of carbamate toxicity. Single-dose activated charcoal may be considered in cases where patients are protecting their airways and present within one hour of toxicity. Inducing emesis is not indicated in this patient, and contact with vomitus can cause toxicity in cases of intentional gastrointestinal ingestions of carbamates. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in patients with evidence of significant respiratory depression as it will not respond to atropine administration. Intubation should also be performed for airway protection if the patient has significant emesis with a depressed level of consciousness. Atropine is indicated for carbamate toxicity with the goal of clearing excessive bronchial secretions and relieving bronchoconstriction. Atropine doses should be doubled every 5 minutes until this effect is reached and then continued at a decreased intravenous drip rate.",

    "explanation": "Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia can cause muscle weakness, but none of these abnormalities is associated with hirsutism. In patients with very high doses of glucocorticoids (GCs), hypokalemia can develop due to partial mineralocorticoid activity of GCs, which can accentuate muscle weakness, but the weakness itself is primarily due to muscle atrophy caused by GCs. Statin-induced myopathy is predominated by muscle pain and tenderness instead of muscle weakness. Also, CPK is raised in statininduced myopathy. This patient has no pain or tenderness, and CPK is in the normal range making this option less likely. The lack of muscle pain and tenderness and normal ESR and CPK make this inflammatory myopathy less likely. This patient is on chronic glucocorticoid therapy, and other features of Cushing syndrome-like facial hirsutism, high blood pressure, weight gain (BMI $3 2 \\mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 2 } )$ ), prominent muscle weakness without pain and tenderness, and ESR and CPK in the normal range indicate glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy more likely.",

    "answer": "c. Monitor for acidosis with serial BMPs",
    "explanation": "This patient is asymptomatic with normal acid-base status. Fomepizole should be given when there is evidence of a toxic alcohol. Methanol is a toxic alcohol metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid. The parent compound, methanol, causes a serum osmolality gap, while formic acid causes anion gap acidosis and retinal toxicity. As the methanol is metabolized, the osmolality gap decreases while the anion gap increases. A serum osmolality gap can be helpful in this situation. If it is elevated, it may support the decision to give fomepizole. However, it cannot be used to rule out the ingestion of toxic alcohol. This patient will require fomepizole to cease the progression of acidosis if it develops. Fomepizole should be given if bicarbonate falls below 15 mEq/L, and then resuscitation should ensue.

    "answer": "c. Acrolein toxicity",
    "explanation": "Hemorrhagic cystitis is a well-documented and potentially serious side effect associated with the use of cyclophosphamide- a chemotherapeutic agent. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used in the treatment of various malignancies and autoimmune disorders, owing to its immunosuppressive and anti-cancer properties. However, one of its drawbacks is its potential to cause inflammation and damage to the urinary bladder lining, resulting in hemorrhagic cystitis. This condition can manifest as lower abdominal pain, dysuria, and gross hematuria, as well as, in severe cases, urinary tract obstruction. The pathogenesis of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis involves the toxic metabolites of the drug, which can irritate and injure the bladder epithelium. Cyclophosphamide undergoes metabolic activation in the liver to form active metabolites, including acrolein. Acrolein is highly reactive and can cause toxic effects, particularly in the urothelial cells of the bladder. This patient's presentation of hematuria, dysuria, flank pain, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels are consistent with hemorrhagic cystitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and bleeding of the bladder lining. This condition is a result of acrolein toxicity. To mitigate this risk, preventive measures such as aggressive hydration, mesna administration (a drug that binds to and neutralizes the toxic metabolites), and dose adjustments are often employed in clinical practice. Despite these precautions, patients receiving cyclophosphamide require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis, and prompt intervention when necessary to minimize its impact on their overall health and quality of life. Renal vein thrombosis typically presents with abdominal/flank pain, hematuria, palpable abdominal mass, and increased blood pressure. Bladder carcinoma may present with hematuria but is less likely in this context due to the recent initiation of cyclophosphamide therapy. Cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression may lead to bone marrow suppression, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, but does not typically cause the specific symptoms described.",

    "answer": "c. Nails",
    "explanation": "Chronic arsenic toxicity or arsenicism should be considered in a patient presenting with multiple basal cell carcinomas over covered sites of the body, with acquired palmoplantar keratoderma or arsenical keratosis. Such patients can also have multiple squamous cell carcinomas and Bowen disease. The concentration of arsenic in hairs and nails increases in a dosedependent manner and indicates arsenic exposure in the preceding 9 months. Toenail arsenic concentration is shown to have a better correlation with the amount of exposure. Drinking water contaminated by arsenic, which leaches from rocks, minerals, and sediments in the earth’s crust, is the major source of chronic arsenic exposure. Hence to establish chronic exposure in a suspected patient, arsenic levels in their drinking water need to be measured. This can be done only in cases where the source of drinking water remains constant. Estimation of arsenic content in a spot-urine sample or 24-hour urine sample can confirm recent arsenic exposure as arsenic is predominantly excreted through urine. It is important to instruct the patient not to consume seafood, including fish for 4 days prior to the test, as the non-toxic organic form of arsenic found in seafood also gets excreted in the urine, leading to overdiagnosis of patient with arsenic poisoning.",

Stridor indicates potential airway compromise and can be caused by airway edema due to caustic injury from lye ingestion. The airway should be secured by oral or nasopharyngeal endotracheal intubation or surgical cricothyrotomy. A cricothyrotomy may be necessary when one \"can't intubate and can't ventilate\" due to severe airway edema, making ventilation and traditional intubation routes difficult or impossible.

Monotherapy may be used in immunocompetent patients with minor puncture wounds (i.e., ciprofloxacin $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ orally twice daily for 5 to 7 days). Hot water immersion therapy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of marine envenomations due to the heat-labile venoms (fish, starfish, and sea urchin).

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Antagonism of muscarinic receptors",
    "explanation": "Organophosphate poisoning commonly results from herbicides and pesticides causing the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, leading to a buildup of acetylcholine, causing the cholinergic toxidrome presented in this clinical vignette. Agonism at muscarinic receptors produces the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning, including diaphoresis, diarrhea, miosis, emesis, excessive lacrimation, and excessive salivation. The more severe signs of toxicity include bradycardia, bronchospasm, and bronchorrhea. Nicotinic agonism can cause fasciculations and muscular weakness. The definitive management for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which antagonizes muscarinic receptors. Although atropine will improve secretions and pupil size, the goal is to improve the patient's hemodynamic parameters. The starting dose for adults is 2 to 5 mg IV. For children, it is 0.05 mg/kg IV until reaching the adult dose. If the patient does not respond to the initial dose, double the dose every 3 to 5 minutes until respiratory secretions have cleared and there is no bronchoconstriction.",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is consistent with the diagnosis of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin is a well-known cardiac glycoside and plays an important role in the contemporary management of appropriately selected patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The presenting symptoms of digoxin toxicity of gastrointestinal discomfort, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting could cause dehydration with decreased renal function and decreased clearance of digoxin. The most lethal symptoms are related to cardiac and neurological systems. An ECG shows scooped ST-segment mostly in the lateral leads, which is termed the \"digitalis effect\". This can be seen with therapeutic levels and toxic. Potassium and digoxin compete for binding at the same site on the sodium/potassium ATPase. When less potassium is bound, more digoxin is bound. As a result, hypokalemia predisposes to the toxicity of digoxin. The most common cause of hypokalemia is medications such as diuretics. Hyperkalemia results as a result of digoxin toxicity and is not a predisposing factor. Treatment of digoxin toxicity involves the correction of hyperkalemia and the administration of digoxin-Fab.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Sodium nitrite",
    "explanation": "The woman in this vignette is suffering from hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Hydrogen sulfide sometimes referred to as sewer gas, is found in gas and petroleum industries, volcanoes, natural hot springs, and sewers. Patients may typically report a strong \"rotten egg\" smell; however, it is important to note that hydrogen sulfide rapidly desensitizes olfactory nerves, and after prolonged exposure, patients may fail to recall the malodorous scent. Sodium nitrite is the first-line treatment for hydrogen sulfide toxicity. It creates methemoglobin, which has a higher affinity for sulfide than hemoglobin. Patients treated with sodium nitrite should be monitored for methemoglobinemia every 30 to 60 minutes, with levels below $30 \\%$ ideal. Hyperbaric oxygen is the treatment used in severe carbon monoxide poisoning and decompression sickness. It has not shown a proven benefit in hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Methylene blue is the treatment for methemoglobinemia. Hydrogen sulfide is treated with sodium nitrite, which can cause methemoglobinemia. If a patient treated with sodium nitrate is thought to be suffering from toxic levels of methemoglobinemia, then methylene blue should be given. Hydroxocobalamin is the first-line treatment for cyanide toxicity. Interestingly, because cyanide and hydrogen sulfide share a similar mechanism of action by affecting the electron transport chain, hydroxocobalamin has shown some benefit in hydrogen sulfide toxicity. It is not the first-line treatment, however.",

    "explanation": "Skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) are only approved for the use of acute musculoskeletal pain. However, they are often used on a chronic basis. Most SMRs can be used safely in patients with liver disease. Drug elimination may be delayed, therefore dosing adjusments may be required. Among the SMR class, only dantroline, tizanidine, and chlorzoxazone have been associated with acute liver injury. The most common adverse effects of SMRs are related to CNS depression and sedation, including confusion, falls, and syncope. These risks are higher for patients on multiple sedating agents. Furthermore, the patient above has a history of alcohol use disorder, which, combined with multiple sedating medications, would put him at high risk for adverse effects of a skeletal muscle relaxant, including abuse potential. There is insufficient evidence to suggest SMRs are effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain; however, chronic pain is not a contraindication to use. Patients with CKD have reduced clearance of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs). However, SMRs are not nephrotoxic and may be used in patients with CKD with appropriate dose adjustments.

Carbon monoxide, implicated here in an intentional poisoning with a motor vehicle, is a common method of suicide as lethal concentrations can be generated in just 10 minutes. Carbon monoxide gas diffuses rapidly across the pulmonary capillary membrane, binding to hemoglobin with a high affinity of 200 times that of oxygen. By displacing oxygen, carbon monoxide decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity and delivery of oxygen to tissues, causing marked cellular hypoxia and acidosis. Methanol classically causes retinal damage due to formic acid production in the setting of toxic alcohol poisoning.

The pharmacologic management of Alzheimer disease is also with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, along with memantine for more severe cases. It is important to keep in mind that these medications are temporizing measures that do not modify the disease itself but are for symptomatic management, i.e., dementia. Diseases such as Parkinson disease and Lewy Body dementia may or may not have dementia as a component of their pathology and thus would not be the correct answers since acetylcholinesterase inhibitors would not address these disease's primary manifestations. Huntington disease does not currently have medications that address the primary disease manifestations, and therapy is aimed at symptomatic treatment, e.g., SSRIs for depression. Parkinson disease is due to a deficit of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, notably the substantia nigra. Due to this disease's etiology, treatments are aimed at increasing CNS levels of dopamine via medications such as carbidopa/levodopa or non-ergot dopamine agonists such as ropinirole or pramipexole. Lewy body dementia is one of the Parkinson-plus syndromes and is defined by frontal cerebral atrophy with relative sparing of the hippocampi. Although this disease is similar to Parkinson disease in terms of pathology related to alpha-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions, this disorder currently has no effective treatment other than supportive, behavioral, and physical therapy.

An aggressive and invasive approach is not warranted until the most likely cause is considered and treated conservatively. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C are always appropriate in elevated liver function tests and fatigue. Discontinuing potentially liver toxic agents and any drugs that have been associated with drug-induced liver disease (DILI) is a prudent first step before more expensive and invasive interventions",

Lactate accumulation may also contribute to acidosis and respiratory acidosis if the patient is hypoventilating secondary to central nervous system depression. Frequent arterial blood gas monitoring is recommended in these patients to monitor the acidosis and assess for other electrolyte abnormalities like hypokalemia. Such patients may be hyperventilating to compensate for the acidosis. If intubation is being considered, make sure the ventilator settings are set up to match the patient's original respiratory rate to prevent a further drop in pH. Sodium bicarbonate may be used to treat metabolic acidosis, but care is necessary to correct associated electrolyte abnormalities like hypokalemia.",

    "answer": "c. Drug interaction",
    "explanation": "The patient is experiencing signs and symptoms of higher than therapeutic level fentanyl plasma levels: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, confusion, decreased respiratory rate, and hypotension. Clarithromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, an enzyme used to metabolize fentanyl. Thus, the concomitant intake of clarithromycin with oral and transdermal fentanyl resulted in increased plasma levels of fentanyl, which contributed to the patient's signs and symptoms. Physicians and healthcare workers must always inquire about which medications a patient is taking before prescribing new medications. Physicians must be vigilant about drug-drug interactions, especially with opioids, since higher plasma levels can lead to fatal respiratory depression. This patient's condition could worsen if no intervention is initiated, as it can lead to respiratory depression secondary to toxic levels of plasma fentanyl. The physician must immediately adjust the patient's oral transmucosal fentanyl dose or consider switching the patient to a different class of antibiotic that does not affect CYP3A4 activity.",

Considering this patient's age, a relatively lower initial dose is utilized at $2 . 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ per day. The patient, however, develops hemorrhagic manifestations, indicating drug toxicity. Cytochrome P450 polymorphisms can explain warfarin toxicity in the absence of other factors predisposing to toxicity. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize it.

The initial management of hypoglycemia is dextrose administration. Dextrose can cause transient hyperglycemia that may lead to the secretion of a higher amount of insulin, causing rebound hypoglycemia.

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Formation of phosgene through cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism.",
    "explanation": "Chloroform toxicity can result in hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity through the formation of phosgene, which is produced during the metabolism of chloroform by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Phosgene binds to glutathione in the liver and kidney, depleting it and causing injury through free radical formation. Hepatic and renal chloroform metabolism is mediated by cytochrome P450; it does not inhibit the enzyme. Chloroform undergoes rapid absorption into the bloodstream and accumulates within adipose tissue. Through its actions, chloroform activates GABA receptors, which subsequently causes hyperpolarization of neurons by facilitating the entry of chloride ions. This neuronal hyperpolarization leads to a sedative effect. Observations have indicated that chloroform possesses the ability to impede potassium channels, which play a critical role in the appropriate repolarization of cardiac cells.

    "explanation": "This elderly female patient presents for an acute visit with symptoms of agitation, sweating, and involuntary jaw contractions. The patient came in a week prior due to a productive cough and took an over-the-counter combination medication which was dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin is an over-the-counter combination medication that works by the combined mechanism of action of both drugs. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, decreasing catecholamine and serotonin reuptake. It acts as a cough suppressant by stopping the transmission of cough impulses by stimulating sigma receptors in the medullary cough center. Guaifenesin acts as an expectorant by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and increasing fluid volume in the respiratory tract, thus decreasing the viscosity of mucous secretions. The patient reported taking an increased dose of dextromethorphan and guaifenesin for the treatment of their symptoms, which puts them at an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin cause an increased risk of serotonin syndrome because dextromethorphan decreases serotonin reuptake. The patient’s symptoms of agitation, sweating, and involuntary jaw contractions fit the description of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by neuromuscular hyperactivity (ex. clonus, hyperreflexia), autonomic overstimulation (ex. raised body temperature, diaphoresis), and agitation. The correct answer is cyproheptadine because it is a 5-HT 2 receptor antagonist that is used to treat serotonin syndrome, which the patient is experiencing. Benztropine is incorrect because it is an M1 antagonist that is used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms of antipsychotics. Entacapone is incorrect because it is a peripheral COMT inhibitor that prevents peripheral methylation of levodopa, thus increasing its bioavailability to treat Parkinson’s disease. Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels, thus providing symptom relief in Alzheimer’s dementia.",

In contrast to chronic or accelerated silicosis, the pathology of acute silicosis is unique and characterized by significant alveolitis and alveolar proteinosis. The inhalation of high-dose respirable crystalline silica (RCS) leads to hypertrophy of type II alveolar pneumocytes and the production of extensive proteinaceous material, most notably surfactant, which becomes denatured and fills the alveoli. Radiographic features of acute silicosis on CT include numerous bilateral centrilobular nodular opacities, ground-glass opacities, and focal consolidation with air bronchograms.

    "explanation": "This patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms consistent with an opioid toxidrome. Opioids bind to multiple opioid receptors, but muopioid receptor agonism is responsible for central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression. The opioid toxidrome includes CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, hypoactive bowel sounds, hyporeflexia, normal or low blood pressure, and normal or low heart rate. In any patient with respiratory failure, airway management is always a priority when administering antidotal therapy. The two best predictors of a positive response to naloxone are CNS depression and a respiratory rate of less than 12 breaths/min. Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist and is generally considered safe and effective. In non-opioid tolerant patients, naloxone has a low risk of adverse events. In patients with opioid-induced respiratory depression, the administration of naloxone may cause acute lung injury. The etiology of acute lung injury is often multifactorial (respiratory efforts against a closed glottis, rapid ventilation of atelectatic areas, etc.). In patients who are apneic or peri-apneic, bag-valve-mask ventilation should be done before naloxone therapy to minimize the risk of acute lung injury.

They increase the frequency of chloride channel opening at the GABA receptor thus, decreasing neuronal firing. Benzodiazepines are used as anxiolytics and in the acute treatment of status epilepticus. They are also used for panic disorder, night terrors, and occasionally as sleep aids. However, benzodiazepines are highly addictive and must be used carefully, especially in patients with any drug use history. Benzodiazepines at higher doses can cause central nervous system (CNS) depression as well as life-threatening respiratory depression. Symptoms of overdose also include ataxia and slurred speech. Barbiturates increase the duration of chloride channel opening rather than the frequency, making their risk of CNS and respiratory depression more likely than with benzodiazepines. Dopamine agonists would not cause respiratory depression, and opioid agonists would cause pinpoint pupils. Also, neither dopamine nor opioid agonists are used as sleep aids.",

    "explanation": "This patient has severe (grade IV) envenomation. Envenomation severity is classified into 5 grades (0 to IV), with grade IV being very severe envenomation characterized by rapidly progressing swelling, bleb formation, and necrosis, as well as systemic symptoms including weakness, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramping, and convulsions. Minimal envenomation (grade 0) is characterized by fang wounds without other signs of envenomation and less than 1 inch of surrounding erythema, without systemic signs or symptoms of envenomation. The current treatment recommendation for crotalid (pit viper) envenomation is to use FabAV polyvalent antivenom. In a usual case with moderate envenomation, 4 to 6 vials of antitoxin are the initial dose. However, in more severe envenomation, it is better to start with a higher dose of 8 vials. Dosing is primarily based on the severity of symptoms at initial presentation and response to treatment. As a general rule, treatment of severe envenomation should start with at least 8 vials of antivenom, then half that amount as a maintenance dose. Treatment of moderate envenomation should begin with at least 4 vials, then half that amount as a maintenance dose. Observation or failure to treat this patient with antivenom is not appropriate, given his history of snakebite and the severity of his symptoms.

    "answer": "b. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)",
    "explanation": "Severe baclofen toxicity can present with bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, loss of brainstem reflexes, and a comatose state similar to brain death. Both baclofen and gamma-hydroxybutyrate are GABA-B agonists. The GABA-B receptor is a heterodimer, located both presynaptically and postsynaptically, explaining why acute baclofen withdrawal and overdose can present with similar signs and symptoms. At therapeutic levels, baclofen primarily binds to the postsynaptic GABA-B receptor, where it acts as an agonist, leading to G-protein activation, causing $\\mathrm { K } +$ ion efflux and hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron, thus reducing neuronal excitability. In acute overdose, baclofen binds to the presynaptic GABA-B receptor and can paradoxically precipitate acute seizures by preventing the release of GABA neurotransmitters into the synapse via autoreceptor stimulation. Baclofen also binds to the postsynaptic GABA-B receptor, causing hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, baclofen overdose can present as a mixed overdose and withdrawal syndrome with variable mental status and autonomic dysfunction. Baclofen withdrawal results from a loss of chronic inhibition of postsynaptic GABA-B receptors, leading to increased excitability of the postsynaptic neuron. This can present clinically with muscle rigidity, spasm, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, and autonomic instability. Phenobarbital and etomidate are GABA-A receptor agonists. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Given his clinical presentation, the patient was unlikely to have overdosed on acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or risperidone.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Sodium channels",
    "explanation": "Postoperative pain control is often very difficult for patients on buprenorphine-naloxone. Buprenorphine has a very strong binding coefficient for the mu receptor and as such, full mu receptor agonists like fentanyl and hydromorphone provide less effective analgesia. Patients on buprenorphine-naloxone therapy exhibit no tolerance to the effects of regional anesthetics. Regional anesthetics have no interactions with buprenorphine-naloxone. Accordingly, it is recommended that regional anesthesia techniques be incorporated into the postoperative analgesia plan whenever possible. Regional anesthetic techniques use local anesthetic to block nociceptive nerve transmission. Local anesthetics such as lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine exert their effects through the blockade of sodium channels. This patient has a history of gastric ulcers, which can be made worse with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs act by inhibiting the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. COX-1 blockade is associated with peptic ulcer disease. Acetaminophen is thought to produce analgesia through inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways. Acetaminophen is not the best option because the patient has transaminitis.

    "explanation": "This patient's occupational history of exposure to a high level of respiratory silica during sandblasting and his classic imaging findings of multiple, well-defined, pulmonary nodules in the upper posterior lobes makes silicosis the most likely diagnosis. Smoking cessation would significantly affect this patient's risk of developing lung cancer, as silica exposure and cigarette smoking have a strong, additive effect on the development of the disease. Respirable crystalline silica is associated with an increased risk of all histologic forms of lung cancer. The progression of silicosis may be confused for malignancy or mask the development of early lung cancers. The two are difficult to distinguish on CT; thus, MR imaging has proven useful. This is because on T2 weighted images, the large conglomerate masses of complicated silicosis have a low intensity, whereas, cancerous cells would display high-intensity signals. Tuberculosis is a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in workers exposed to silica, particularly in regions with high rates of TB and HIV.

The labs show a decreased ${ \\mathrm { H C O } } _ { 3 }$ concentration, decreased $\\mathbf { P a C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration, a low pH, and increased creatinine which points to metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Metabolic acidosis along with gasping respirations and convulsions in a neonate point to neonate gasping syndrome due to overthe-counter dextromethorphan and guaifenesin which contains benzyl alcohol. Gasping syndrome occurs in preterm neonates who are exposed to high concentrations of benzyl alcohol. This patient had a productive cough for the past 3 days, which the parents tried to treat with a dangerous over-the-counter medication, dextromethorphan and guaifenesin, a common combination drug used to treat productive cough. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, decreasing catecholamine and serotonin reuptake. It also agonizes sigma-1 receptors in the medullary cough center and thus suppresses the transmission of cough impulses. Guaifenesin acts as an expectorant by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and increasing fluid volume in the respiratory tract, thus decreasing the viscosity of mucous secretions. Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin also contain small amounts of benzyl alcohol. The correct answer is benzyl alcohol because the doses of dextromethorphan and guaifenesin that the parents gave the neonate increased benzyl alcohol levels and thus caused the neonatal gasping syndrome as benzyl alcohol is the causative agent of this syndrome. Phenylalanine and sodium methylcellulose do not cause metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation and are thus incorrect. Formic acid is incorrect because although it does cause metabolic acidosis, formic acid is not present in formulations of dextromethorphan and guaifenesin.",

To detect a comprehensive series of drugs potentially used in drugfacilitated sexual assault cases at very low concentrations (because of the long interval between alleged intake and sampling), sensitive broadspectrum techniques like liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry must be used. Immunoassays developed for workplace drug testing have cut-offs that are often too high. Despite claims in the popular press that gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and flunitrazepam are the most frequently used drugs in drug-facilitated sexual assault, surveys have shown that GHB is used in a maximum of $4 \\%$ of the cases. Because GHB is an endogenous substance, the cut-off must be placed high in order to differentiate exogenous from endogenous levels. Therefore, it can only be detected after administration of up to 5 hours in blood and 12 hours in urine.",

    "explanation": "If they are bound by the protein strongly, it would be difficult to excrete in the urine. If minimally protein-bound, there are fewer interactions that are needed to occur before the drug is eliminated in the urine. The goal of urinary alkalinization is to achieve a urine pH of 7.5 or higher while maintaining a serum pH between 7.55 to 7.60. This is generally done by giving a bolus of $\\mathrm { 1 - 2 ~ m E q / k g }$ of 8.4 percent sodium bicarbonate, followed by continuous infusion. Before the beginning of therapy, baseline measurements should be done for electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glucose, systemic and urinary pH, and serum drug concentrations. Drugs that are likely to respond to urinary alkalinization usually meet four criteria. They are predominantly eliminated unchanged by the kidney, are distributed primarily in the extracellular fluid compartment, are minimally protein-bound and are weak acids with pKa ranging from 3.0 to 7.5.",

    "explanation": "This patient who developed systemic symptoms of severe muscle cramps, headache, hypertension, and diaphoresis after a jellyfish sting, has signs and symptoms consistent with Irukandji syndrome. Up to 25 jellyfish species have been implicated in causing Irukandji syndrome with their stings, but the species Carukia barnesi is the most wellknown. The mainstay of treatment for Irukandji syndrome is supportive, as there is no specific antivenom for Irukandji syndrome. Opioid analgesics, nitrates, phentolamine, magnesium, and benzodiazepines are some of the recommended treatment options by consensus guidelines. Although rare, intracranial hemorrhage secondary to persistent severe hypertension in Irukandji syndrome has been documented in the scientific literature. As this patient developed a sudden change in mental status, is exhibiting new asymmetrical pupils, and is taking anticoagulation, there is a high clinical suspicion for intracranial hemorrhage. As such, computed tomography of the brain would be indicated in this scenario. Although the patient received opiates, his sudden change in mental status and asymmetrical pupils rather than the bilateral pinpoint pupils that are classically seen in opiate use suggests an intracranial hemorrhage rather than opiate overdose. Although the patient could have possibly had a seizure and a post-ictal state secondary to intracranial hemorrhage, in the absence of any witnessed seizure-like activity, evaluation for intracranial hemorrhage should take place first. Hypoglycemia is an important consideration for any acute changes in mental status, but this patient’s blood glucose level is within normal limits, so IV dextrose administration would not likely be of any benefit.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Respiratory and metabolic alkalosis with anion gap metabolic acidosis",
    "explanation": "An elevated pH with decreased PaCO2 level indicates respiratory alkalosis. The expected compensation is a $2 \\mathrm { m E q / L }$ decrease in serum bicarbonate level for every 10 mmHg decrease in PaCO2 in acute respiratory alkalosis. In chronic respiratory alkalosis, the expected compensation is a 4 to 5 mEq/L decrease in serum bicarbonate level for every $1 0 \\mathrm { m m H g }$ decrease in PaCO2. His expected serum bicarbonate level is 14 to $1 6 \\mathrm { m E q / L }$ (for an approximately $2 0 \\mathrm { m m H g }$ decrease in PaCO2). The expected serum bicarbonate level is calculated as normal serum bicarbonate level minus the compensation i.e. $2 4 \\mathrm { m E q / L }$ minus 8 to $1 0 \\mathrm { m E q / L }$ . Since the measured bicarbonate level is higher than expected, metabolic alkalosis is also present. He also has an elevated anion gap of $2 2 \\mathrm { m E q / L }$ , which is calculated as sodium concentration minus the sum of chloride and bicarbonate levels. This indicates the presence of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. A delta-delta ratio should be calculated to further quantify the metabolic disturbance. The delta-delta ratio is calculated as the change in the anion gap divided by the change in the bicarbonate level. This patient's deltadelta ratio is 2.5 (22-12)/(24-20). A delta-delta ratio of greater than 2 indicates metabolic alkalosis. This patient presents with typical complications of salicylate toxicity. He has respiratory alkalosis from tachypnea, salicylate-induced high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and vomiting-induced metabolic alkalosis, with metabolic alkalosis as the primary metabolic disturbance.",

    "answer": "d. Gyromitrin is hydrolyzed in the stomach and converted by oxidation in the liver.",
    "explanation": "Gyromitrin is converted to the active metabolite monomethylhydrazine (MMH) in the liver. Gyromitrin directly binds to and inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase, the enzyme responsible for transforming dietary vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) into active pyridoxal 5-phosphate. Without the cofactor pyridoxal 5- phosphate, the central nervous system enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) cannot convert glutamate to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). As GABA is depleted, activation of inhibitory postsynaptic chloride channels decreases, resulting in a relative excitatory state in the brain, leading to delayed seizures. Gyromitrin is oxidized in the liver, not glucuronidated. Esterases do not affect its metabolism. In the stomach, gyromitrin is metabolized to MMH, which is the active metabolite responsible for inhibiting many enzymatic processes, particularly by the inhibition of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). It is converted in the liver by cytochrome P-450 oxidation into N-methylhydrazine (MMH).",

Radiographic studies may be obtained to determine the presence of opaque foreign bodies or \"lead lines\" (hyperdense metaphyseal bands visualized on radiography). Whole-bowel irrigation, parenteral chelation, and intensive care unit admission is the best next step in managing this case. These foreign bodies will likely be adherent to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, thereby rendering surgical removal complicated. Whole-bowel irrigation is typically much more effective in mobilizing lead. Reporting the patient's family is not the best next course of action.

    "explanation": "Chlordiazepoxide is the prototypical member of the benzodiazepine class. It binds to benzodiazepine receptors at the GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel complex and enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA. It is a long-acting anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, sedative, appetite-stimulating, hypnotic, and amnesic properties when treating anxiety, preoperative apprehension, alcohol withdrawal, or catatonia (off-label). In chlordiazepoxide overdose or toxicity, the patient may present with confusion, diminished reflexes, comatose, or drowsiness. Interventions include securing the airway and providing adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation. Patient respiration, blood pressure, and pulse must have regular monitoring. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used for a partial or complete reversal of the sedative property of benzodiazepines, is an option for treatment. Flumazenil works by competitive inhibition of the alpha-beta subunit GABA binding site to insert its effect.

    "explanation": "This patient is exhibiting signs of ackee fruit (Blighia sapida) toxicity, also known as Jamaican vomiting sickness. Ackee fruit poisoning is caused by the ingestion of unripe yellow arils of the fruit that contains three large, shiny black seeds. Unripe ackee fruit contains a protoxin called hypoglycin A, which is metabolized to methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA). MCPA overall inhibits gluconeogenesis causing severe hypoglycemia by the following: 1) blocking the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (a source of NADH in mitochondria) via inhibiting the enzyme carnitine-acylCoA transferase, 2) inhibiting the metabolism of glycogenic amino acids and blocking its entrance into the TCA cycle, and 3) preventing transport of malate out of the mitochondria.

It is also an essential component of commercial products like firearms' ammunition, paints, solders, and gasoline. The symptoms of lead toxicity can range from headache, irritability, constipation, and abdominal pain to more severe ones like coma and convulsions. Continuous exposure can chronically cause learning disorders (in children) and motor neuropathy (wrist and foot drop). Lead lines are seen on gingivae (Burton lines), and lines are also visible at the metaphysis of long bones on an x-ray. Laboratory investigations would reveal microcytic hypochromic anemia. In addition, erythrocyte basophilic stippling is also present. Blood lead levels 50 mcg/dL usually indicate mild toxicity, between 50- 70 mcg/dL depict moderate level toxicity, and levels from 70-100 mcg/dl are associated with severe toxicity. Therefore, lead levels and symptoms should be taken into account when determining which treatment modality needs to be adopted. Mild toxicity, in the absence of symptoms, does not need any specific therapy. A follow-up in 1 month for the reassessment of blood lead levels is, however, indicated. Moderate toxicity is treated through chelation. Succimer may be appropriate for outpatient treatment if the patient does not have significant encephalopathy and can tolerate oral medication. Severe poisoning causing encephalopathy requires intramuscular dimercaprol, followed by CaNa2EDTA chelation.

    "explanation": "Gyromitra esculenta mushrooms are known as \"false morels\" due to their similar appearance to morels. The gyromitra mushrooms cause central nervous system toxicity by interfering with the enzymatic reactions of which pyridoxine is a cofactor. This is a similar mechanism to isoniazid poisoning. One of the key reactions is the conversion of glutamic acid to GABA by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Often standard anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin and benzodiazepines, do not have any effect until vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is repleted, GAD activity resumes, and GABA can be produced. The treatment is pyridoxine $2 5 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ intravenously.",

    "explanation": "Anti-fouling paint is a specialized category of coatings applied as the outer (outboard) layer to the hull of a ship or boat. They often contain organotin compounds (OTCs). Organotin toxicity has been observed to result in the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and resulting mitochondrial damage, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress resulting in renal damage. OTCs also can directly inhibit H/K-ATPase, particularly in intercalated cells in the kidney, which results in hypokalemia, renal tubular acidity, and increased urinary pH. The most likely manifestation of repeated damage to the intercalated renal cells is chronic kidney disease. Organotin exposure has not been associated with increased instances of colon cancer or heart failure. It has been associated with tremors but not essential tremors.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Polytetrafluoroethylene degradation products",
    "explanation": "An acute flu-like illness that occurs in the setting of leaving a pan on the burner for many hours suggests polymer fume fever. If further inquiry into the exact type of pan she was using suggested a nonstick variety, this would strongly suggest the diagnosis. At temperatures over $3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , the polytetrafluoroethylene coating on the pan begins to decompose, releasing various fluoropolymer degradation products. These degradation products most likely activate neutrophils leading to an inflammatory cascade culminating in the systemic flu-like symptoms of polymer fume fever. Clinically significant phosgene exposure causes severe, delayed pulmonary edema, which should be visible on a chest x-ray. Although frequently associated with chemical weapons, it may also be produced through overheating chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as welding-induced decomposition of trichloroethylene. Although carbon monoxide poisoning is a reasonable consideration, a concentration of $6 \\%$ falls well within the normal range for individuals who smoke 1 pack of cigarettes daily. Further, carbon monoxide poisoning is not generally associated with hyperpyrexia. Metal fume fever may cause a similar constellation of symptoms; however, a history of exposure to metal fumes either occupationally or through one’s home hobbies is required for diagnosis.",

Species of zoanthid corals like Palythoa and Zoanthus species can contain a highly toxic and potentially lethal chemical compound known as palytoxin. Coral toxicity, therefore, is palytoxin toxicity. Aquarium shop workers and home aquarium hobbyists may be at increased risk of exposure. Coral toxicity due to inhalation or contact exposure may result in various local (swelling, redness, itching) and systemic symptoms depending upon the mode and duration of exposure. In recent years, there is growing evidence of inhalational or cutaneous exposure to PTX toxicity associated with corals. It mostly occurs after the handling of PTX-contaminated soft corals, mostly during the cleaning and maintenance of home/public marine aquaria.

    "explanation": "Four basic levels of personal protective equipment were defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for hazmat incident response; levels A, B, C, and D. The level of protection needed is determined by the nature of the substance in question. Level A is the highest level of protection. It protects from both contact and vapor or gas hazards. It consists of a completely encapsulated suit and a selfcontained breathing apparatus with a tight seal between the suit and the inner layer of the face, hands, and feet. This is the most common level used to enter hot zones. Ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas, that produces skin and respiratory symptoms like the ones reported by the victims in this case. A level A of protection should be used by first responders when attending incidents that involve ammonia. A Tyvek suit provides poor protection as most chemicals can penetrate easily. Tyvek suits are not included in the personal protective equipment levels defined by the OSHA. Level C consists of a splash suit with an air-purifying respirator.

    "answer": "c. Pulmonary edema",
    "explanation": "One of the most feared complications of scorpion stings is pulmonary edema and subsequently cardiogenic shock. The effect of the scorpion sting is highly dependent on the species. While species like Centruroides and Parabuthus cause neuromuscular issues, Buthus, Mesobuthus, and Androctonus exhibit life-threatening cardiovascular effects. This is an example of a grade 4 envenomation. Grade 4 envenomations include both cranial nerve and skeletal muscle dysfunction. This can cause hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary edema, and multiple organ failures. Antivenom is critical in this situation. When the venom affects the sodium channels, this may manifest as seizure-like activity in the patient and obscure the clinical picture, especially when the child or infant is unable to relay an accurate history. Intubation may be required in these patients, as motor hyperactivity of the pharyngeal muscles and uncontrolled diaphragmatic and intercostal neuromuscular activity may be seen. These symptoms may progress quickly, causing impending airway collapse. In the select species causing cardiopulmonary effects, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and more importantly, cardiogenic shock may be seen.",

    "explanation": "Buprenorphine and naloxone are commonly prescribed in office-based opioid agonist treatment (OBOT) programs. The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone is formulated to be taken orally. Naloxone is poorly absorbed when taken orally. Only the buprenorphine component is absorbed in physiologically-active amounts. When this medication's film or tablet forms are dissolved and injected, the naloxone will be active in the systemic circulation. Because this patient has an ongoing, active opiate use disorder, the naloxone will competitively inhibit the mu-receptor, and the patient will likely experience typical opiate withdrawal symptoms.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Ketamine",
    "explanation": "This adolescent female patient presented with a productive cough for the past week and took an over-the-counter combination of medication which was dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. This medication treats coughs with high production of phlegm by suppressing the cough through dextromethorphan and decreasing the viscosity of mucus secretions through guaifenesin. Guaifenesin acts as an irritant and activates gastric vagal receptors which then stimulates cholinergic activity to increase fluid secretion in the respiratory tract. Because guaifenesin is a xanthine derivative, it relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchodilation. These two actions by guaifenesin allow the mucus to become less viscous and thus less problematic. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist and nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, decreasing catecholamine and serotonin reuptake. Dextromethorphan suppresses cough by stopping the transmission of cough impulses by stimulating sigma receptors in the medullary cough center. The correct answer is ketamine because ketamine’s mechanism of action also antagonizes NMDA receptors. Ketamine is used for the induction of anesthesia, and it causes dissociative anesthesia. The question also referred to the patient feeling dissociated from herself, hallucinations, and pressured speech. This is due to a possible side effect of dextromethorphan being severe acute psychosis. Fluoxetine is incorrect because it acts by preventing the reuptake of serotonin. Codeine is incorrect because it is an opioid that acts via agonizing µ- opioid receptors. Etomidate is incorrect because it is an anesthetic that acts via potentiation of GABAA receptors.",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of fulminant hepatic failure due to acetaminophen toxicity. Acetaminophen is a first-line medication for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Metabolism primarily occurs through glucuronidation and sulfuration, both in the liver. These pathways are saturated in an overdose, and more acetaminophen is metabolized to NAPQI by cytochrome P450. NAPQI is a toxic substance that is safely reduced by glutathione to nontoxic mercaptate and cysteine compounds, which are then renally excreted. An overdose depletes glutathione stores, and once they reach less than $30 \\%$ of normal, NAPQI levels increase and subsequently bind to hepatic macromolecules causing hepatic necrosis. This is irreversible. Acetaminophen toxicity is the second most common cause of liver transplantation worldwide and the most common in the US.",

    "answer": "c. Zone 3",
    "explanation": "The functional unit of the liver is the lobule. Each lobule is hexagonal with a portal triad (portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct) at each corner of the hexagon. The foundation of the lobule is composed of hepatocytes. Based on function and perfusion, hepatocytes are divided into three zones. Zone I is considered the periportal region of hepatocytes. These hepatocytes are the best perfused and first to regenerate due to their proximity to oxygenated blood and nutrients. Due to its high perfusion, zone I plays a large role in oxidative metabolisms such as betaoxidation, gluconeogenesis, bile formation, cholesterol formation, and amino acid catabolism. Zone 1 is affected first by viral hepatitis. Zone II is defined as the pericentral region of the hepatocytes and sits between zones I and III. This zone is termed the intermediate zone and is affected by yellow fever. Zone III is the pericentral (centrilobular) zone and has the lowest perfusion due to its distance from the portal triad. It is affected first by ischemia and is most sensitive to metabolic toxins (e.g., ethanol, rifampin, paracetamol, halothane, CCl4). This zone has a high concentration of cytochrome P-450 and is the site of alcoholic hepatitis.",

    "answer": "b. GABA-A receptor agonist",
    "explanation": "Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine receptor modulator primarily approved by the FDA-approved for short-term treatment of insomnia aimed at patients with difficulty starting sleep. It improves measures of sleep latency, and sleep duration, and reduces the number of awakenings in patients with transient insomnia. It improves sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia as well and can act as a minor muscle relaxant. The mechanism of zolpidem is GABA-A receptor agonism. Zolpidem side effects include sleepwalking and night eating syndrome. Additionally, a serious adverse effect reported from treatment with zolpidem is a behavior called sleep-driving, in which the patient drives while not fully awake with no recollection of the event. Consumption of alcohol or any other CNS depressant will increase these events as they enhance sedation. In these cases, the drug needs to be discontinued. Drug overdose with zolpidem involves CNS depression, cognitive impairments leading to somnolence or coma, cardiovascular and respiratory depression, and other fatalities. The acute toxicity of zolpidem is less in severity in comparison to other short-acting benzodiazepines like triazolam and midazolam.

    "answer": "a. Pyridoxine",
    "explanation": "Isoniazid (INH) is a potent bactericidal antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Treatment with INH therapy has a risk of toxicity, which can be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity presents as altered mental status, seizures, and sometimes status epilepticus. The first signs and symptoms of isoniazid toxicity usually appear 30 minutes to two hours after ingestion. They include nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, dizziness, tachycardia, and urinary retention, followed by stupor, coma, and recurrent grand mal seizures. The important mechanism is a deficiency of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The pyridoxine deficiency induced by using INH leads to reduced production of GABA, as it is usually a product of a pyridoxine-dependent decarboxylation reaction. Acute toxicity is approached by strict airway management, activated charcoal if the patient presents early, seizure management with benzodiazepines and pyridoxine administration. This helps with the rapid restoration of GABA stores. Initial care should include airway assessment, intravenous access, complete blood count, toxicology screening, pregnancy test, and intravenous fluids.",

    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Supportive care with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
    "explanation": "The mainstay of treatment for acute benzodiazepine toxicity is supportive care, which may include endotracheal intubation to provide definitive airway management. Single-dose or multi-dose activated charcoal, hemodialysis, or whole bowel irrigation play no role in the management of benzodiazepine toxicity. Flumazenil is a nonspecific competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine receptor that can reverse benzodiazepine-induced sedation. However, in most cases, the risks of flumazenil usually outweigh the benefits in acute toxicity, and thus flumazenil is not recommended for routine reversal of this sedative agent. Flumazenil can precipitate acute withdrawal syndromes in those with chronic benzodiazepine dependence, which can be life-threatening. If a patient who has a chronic dependence on benzodiazepines is given flumazenil, it can lower their seizure threshold and potentially cause life-threatening seizures.",

    "answer": "c. Acute pulmonary edema",
    "explanation": "This patient has cutaneous burns from sulfur mustard exposure leaking from an unused World War 1 artillery shell. Although burns can be extensive, most patients survive sulfur mustard exposure. Respiratory tract injury occurs when the chemical is inhaled, but an apparent injury is usually delayed 12 to 48 hours after exposure. The warm, moist environment of the upper airway contributes to increased absorption and severe injury in significant respiratory tract exposures. Sulfur mustard damages the respiratory epithelium causing inflammation and necrosis. Tracheobronchial tree edema ensues, and injury is localized predominantly to the upper airway and large bronchi. This structural damage leads to clinical signs of a cough, hoarseness, excess sputum production, and dyspnea. High-concentration exposures can cause pulmonary edema, bronchopneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Death can occur from acute pulmonary edema or secondary pulmonary infection. Pancytopenia may result from significant sulfur mustard exposures, but disseminated intravascular coagulation would be a rare complication. Sulfur mustard does spread through the bloodstream and is ultimately filtered through the kidneys. It rarely causes mortality via systemic spread leading to multiorgan dysfunction.",

    "explanation": "Alcohol withdrawal symptoms occur when patients stop drinking or significantly decrease their alcohol intake after long-term dependence. Withdrawal has a broad range of symptoms from mild tremors to a condition called delirium tremens, which results in seizures and could progress to death if not recognized and treated promptly. The reported mortality rates for patients who experience delirium tremens is anywhere from $1 \\%$ . GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous center. GABA has particular binding sites available for ethanol, thus increasing the inhibition of the central nervous system when present. Chronic ethanol exposure to GABA creates constant inhibition or depressant effects on the brain. Ethanol also binds to glutamate, one of the excitatory amino acids in the central nervous system. When it binds to glutamate, it inhibits the excitation of the central nervous system, thus worsening the depression of the brain. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, is the precursor to GABA. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle is a bidirectional transfer of carbon and nitrogen units by which neurons convert glutamine into glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters. The hallmark of management for severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal is the administration of long-acting benzodiazepines. The most commonly used benzodiazepines are intravenous diazepam or intravenous lorazepam for management. Patients with severe withdrawal symptoms may require escalating doses and intensive care level monitoring. Early consultation with a toxicologist is recommended to assist with aggressive management as these patients may require benzodiazepine doses at a level higher than the practitioner is comfortable with to manage their symptoms.",

Other peroxidases in the body may also reduce hydrogen peroxide, but they are not specific to hydrogen peroxide and generally play a more significant role in different reactions. Hydrogen peroxide is quickly reduced to water and oxygen gas when introduced to catalase.

Because such large amounts of gas are released, small quantities of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause significant air emboli if ingested or directly introduced into the bloodstream.

    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Interruption of enterohepatic toxin recirculation",
    "explanation": "Hemodialysis is not expected to be effective in removing toxins, and patients often present in a delayed fashion after toxicity is present. Multi-dose activated charcoal may bind amatoxin undergoing enterohepatic recirculation and thus increase clearance and diminish toxicity even hours after exposure. Intravenous volume resuscitation is critical to maintain renal perfusion, while effective for minor cases antidotal therapy with silymarin is often used to attempt to prevent liver uptake of amatoxin within 24 hours of ingestion. Penicillin may also decrease the uptake of amatoxin into hepatocytes but does not specifically interrupt recirculation. Depletion of pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) is the mechanism of toxicity for gyromitrin-containing mushrooms. Cimetidine inhibition of CYP-450 hepatic enzymes has a theoretical basis for a single animal study, but induction of these enzymes has no role in treatment. Amatoxin is rapidly taken up into the hepatocyte and then excreted via the biliary system. The cycle of enterohepatic recirculation can be interrupted most simply with multi-dose activated charcoal given every 2 to 4 hours, or in extreme cases biliary suction or drainage. Bilary drainage however is invasive and insufficient data exist at this time to recommend its use.",

Heroin acts agonistically on central nervous system (CNS) opioid receptors mu, kappa, and delta. Clonidine works to help with the symptomatology of opioid withdrawal. It is most commonly used in hypertensive patients. Clonidine blocks norepinephrine release and decreases the autonomic instability associated with opioid withdrawal. Repeat dosing with naloxone is likely to worsen the patient's condition. The patient is already in withdrawal and requires treatment of the underlying etiology of the withdrawal, which is sympathetic overtone, best treated with clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist.

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Naloxone challenge",
    "explanation": "Overdose of stimulants, such as amphetamines, would account for the initial psychosis, agitation, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. Mixed toxicity with an opioid, such as heroin, would result in somnolence and miosis. This combination of stimulants and opioids is referred to as a \"speedball.\" A naloxone challenge would result in a reversal of somnolence if opioids are present and preclude further extensive workup. Amphetamines alone can cause initial hyperadrenergic symptoms that may be followed later by a period of somnolence due to amphetamineinduced catecholamine depletion. Pinpoint pupils would not fit with this single-drug toxidrome. Patients who use amphetamines frequently use other drugs such as opioids and ethanol. If naloxone challenge resulted in no change in this patient's somnolence and miosis, further testing such as head CT to rule out intracranial hemorrhage would be indicated. Creatine phosphokinase is elevated for amphetamine toxicity resulting in rhabdomyolysis.

    "explanation": "Agricultural fertilizers can contain hexavalent chromium, and farmers can be occupationally exposed through their use, particularly in the absence of personal protective equipment. This patient's symptom association with the growing season points toward occupational exposure. Dermal exposure to hexavalent chromium causes contact dermatitis mediated by a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This causes dry, cracked skin and erythema after repeated exposure and can lead to the development of skin thickening, blisters, ulcers, and eczema. Dermal exposure and skin sensitization also increase the risk for respiratory sensitization and the development of occupational asthma, particularly in an aerosolized form. Additionally, chronic inhalation exposure carries an increased lifetime risk of lung cancer, and abnormal pulmonary function could direct management for further investigation. He also may benefit from fitting for a respirator to use while mixing his fertilizer to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure and always wearing gloves. Skin biopsy and sensitization testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis at later visits, but these are more invasive tests.

She was recently prescribed methocarbamol for low back pain by an urgent care provider. Her home medications include amlodipine, amitriptyline, and oxybutynin. Her vital signs show temperature 99.0 F, blood pressure $1 1 7 / 8 4 \\mathrm { m m H g }$ , heart rate $9 4 / \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ , respiratory rate 14/min, and oxygen saturation $9 9 \\%$ on room air. She is oriented to self. She spontaneously answers yes or no questions but is not oriented to time or place. She does not have nystagmus, and the cranial nerve exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has lower abdominal tenderness. A bladder ultrasound reveals approximately $6 5 0 \\mathrm { m L }$ of retained urine.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Anticholinergic CNS depression",
    "explanation": "The Beers criteria strongly recommends avoiding the use of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) in the elderly due to anticholinergic properties. While the mechanism of action of most anti-spasmodic SMRs is not fully elucidated, anticholinergic global CNS depression is characteristic of several SMRs, including cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, carisoprodol, tizanidine, and others. This patient takes two other medications with anticholinergic properties, amitriptyline, and oxybutynin, which are also to be avoided in elderly patients. The recent addition of an SMR with anticholinergic properties likely contributed to this patient's presentation of anticholinergic toxicity, including confusion, dizziness, tachycardia, and urinary retention. Tizanidine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that is an agonist at alpha-2- receptors, which is responsible for its anti-spastic properties. Tizanidine also has anticholinergic properties, which are more likely to contribute to this patient's presentation of altered mental status, tachycardia, and urinary retention. Skeletal muscle relaxation via inhibition of calcium ion efflux from sarcoplasmic reticulum describes the mechanism of action of dantrolene. Dantrolene is an antispastic agent that would not be prescribed for low back pain. It would also be unlikely to contribute to anticholinergic toxicity. Inhibition of monoamine reuptake at presynaptic neurons describes the therapeutic mechanism of action of amitriptyline. The anticholinergic properties of amitriptyline are responsible for the patient's presentation.",

    "explanation": "The patient presents after ingesting a toxic dose of a tricyclic antidepressant, which is a sodium channel blocker. It can cause metabolic, cardiac, and neurologic symptoms. Patients with potential sodium channel blocker toxicity require an immediate electrocardiogram (ECG). The toxicity of sodium channel blockers leads to a widening of the QRS complex and a lengthening of the QT interval. The cornerstone of treatment is the administration of sodium bicarbonate. It is indicated for patients with an ECG demonstrating a QRS duration ${ > } 1 0 0$ ms or any suspicious QT prolongation or dysrhythmia. Sodium bicarbonate is beneficial in raising the serum pH and increasing the extracellular sodium. Alkalinization leads to an increase in the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes, which helps to offload sodium channels. It might also increase the protein binding of the offending agent. Patients should be given 1-2 mEq/kg as a bolus dose. Bolus doses can be administered until the QRS duration is $1 0 0 \\mathrm { { m s } }$ .

Aspirin (salicylate) directly stimulates the medullary respiratory center to cause tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. In addition, aspirin causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to increased production and decreased renal elimination of organic acids (eg, lactic acid, ketoacids). Although thiamine deficiency can cause elevation of lactate levels in the setting of beriberi, it does not cause respiratory alkalosis. Serum osmolality should be measured in suspected cases with anion gap acidosis, given ingestion of certain substances such as ethylene glycol or methanol can cause metabolic acidosis and an osmolal gap.

Moreover, when used chronically, it can cause violent behavior, mood swings, and psychosis such as paranoia, delirium, auditory and visual hallucination, and delusions. Chronic long-term methamphetamine use can be highly addictive, and if it is discontinued abruptly, it might lead to withdrawal symptoms that can be persistent for months after use. Methamphetamine affects the central nervous system (CNS) by enhancing the release of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The use of methamphetamine can lead to many pharmacological effects because of its ability to use various molecular processes. Methamphetamine discharges the monoamines out of their storage and frees them into the synaptic space by reversing the dopamine transporters. Additionally, it obstructs the reuptake of monoamines by preventing the activity of transporters of monoamine. Methamphetamine can increase the expression of CRE-Luc by TAAR1 in transfected cells. Methamphetamine interacts with TAAR1, which triggers a definite inhibition in dopamine uptake dependent on TAAR1 in transfected cells. Methamphetamine has a similar effect on brain striatal synaptosomes. Methamphetamine reduces the dopamine transporters' expressions at the cell surface and increases the proliferation of the cytosolic levels of monoamines by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase activity. Additionally, the substance enhances the expression and activity of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Methamphetamine is highly lipid-soluble, which helps to be transferred relatively fast across the blood-brain barrier and has an immediate effect on the CNS. The last stage of methamphetamine misuse happens when the person who inappropriately uses methamphetamine becomes paranoid and irritable because of a lack of sleep for about 3 to 15 days. This behavior is called \"tweaking,\" and the person with this behavior is known as the \"tweaker.\" Usually, tweakers continue to require more methamphetamine to get to the original high. This effect is difficult to achieve, which causes frustration and irritability, and unsteady behavior in the tweaker. Because tweakers are unpredictable, they can behave violently, get involved in domestic arguments, spur-of-the-moment offenses, and become a danger to others or themselves. The use of methamphetamine can cause physical and psychological dependence and increased tolerance. Because of the rapid development of tolerance, methamphetamine users frequently need to increase the dose to get to the satisfying \"high,\" which can be very dangerous because the administration of too much methamphetamine also increases the risk of an overdose. Based on the reports from 2011, more than 102,000 emergency department visits in the United States were related to methamphetamine use, with over $5 0 \\%$ of users also using a combination of other drugs such as alcohol and marijuana, thus producing a synergistic effect.",

He has had a similar rash in the past and thinks he got it from a plant. He has a summer job with the Forest Service. Dermal contact with which of the following toxins is responsible for the patient's rash?",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Urushiol",
    "explanation": "The patient has likely encountered one of the Toxicodendron species given his profession. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are three notable species within the larger family, Anacardiaceae. Urushiol is the primary allergen in Toxicodendron exposure and causes an intensely pruritic papulovesicular rash that typically has a linear-like appearance. Urushiol is comprised of multiple oily-based catechols that cause a type IV hypersensitivity reaction upon contact. Direct contact with the sap containing this toxin, indirect contact (e.g. tools) exposed to this toxin, and even inhalation via burning plants containing this toxin are all routes of exposure. Appropriate protective clothing can minimize exposures (e.g. long sleeve shirts, pants) and washing body parts with soap and water after exposure. Contact dermatitis secondary to Urushiol exposure can be treated with anti-histamines for pruritus and local or systemic steroids depending on the location and extent. Hypoglycin A and B are two toxins found within the unripened Ackee fruit (Blighia sapida) and ingestion can lead to a syndrome called \"Jamaican vomiting sickness\". Gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycemia can be seen after ingestion. Ingestion can also result in hepatotoxicity, ranging from microvesicular hepatotoxicity and even fulminant liver failure in some cases. Cicutoxin is found in the water hemlock plant (Cicuta maculata) which is an antagonist to the GABA receptor and can result in seizures, sedation/coma, and cholinergic effects. Calcium oxalate crystals are found in a variety of plants and can cause dermal irritation and if ingested depending on its solubility, kidney injury.",

    "explanation": "The etiology of nerve agent toxicity is primarily environmental exposure. Patients can be exposed to nerve agents through agriculture and bioterrorism. Organophosphates and carbamates found in many insecticides commonly cause toxicity in agricultural and industrial workers. Nerve agent toxicity causes excessive cholinergic stimulation which leads to the classic DUMBELS symptomatology; defecation, urination, muscle weakness, miosis, bradycardia, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, and salivation. ACh binding at nicotinic receptors results in muscle fasciculations, cramps, weakness, paralysis, and areflexia. ACh can also stimulate the brain where it can induce seizures and coma. Atropine works by binding and blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, thus preventing the buildup of acetylcholine from continuing to affect the receptors. Because atropine does not act on nicotinic receptors, it will not improve skeletal muscle symptoms.",

    "explanation": "This patient is showing signs of local anesthetic toxicity from ropivacaine administration. The maximum recommended dose for ropivacaine is $3 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ , so for this $5 5 \\mathrm { k g }$ female, up to $1 6 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ of ropivacaine can be safely administered. She received $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ total and is at risk of toxicity. Lipid emulsion is suspected to serve as a lipid sink, binding the local anesthetic from cardiac tissue, allowing for stabilization and return to regular action potential firing and myocardial function. Although considered less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine because of the formulation as the S enantiomer, local anesthetic toxicity can still occur. When suspected, lipid emulsion is the first-line drug of choice. Administration of atropine is not indicated in acute local anesthetic toxicity. It is highly unlikely for $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m c g }$ of fentanyl to render this patient apneic. The patient should receive immediate resuscitative efforts, in this case, mask ventilation and securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. Given the timing and dosage of the administration of ropivacaine, it is much more likely that toxicity produced the respiratory effects rather than the dose of fentanyl. Due to the intermediate duration of action of ropivacaine, it is recommended that if local anesthetic toxicity is suspected, lipid emulsion be immediately administered while also coordinating for a possible escalation of care, including cardiopulmonary bypass or institution of ECMO. Epinephrine is indicated in ACLS conditions. Given the timing of the cardiovascular collapse, the etiology of collapse is secondary to ropivacaine toxicity. When local anesthetic toxicity is the likely etiology, the dose of epinephrine needs to be reduced from the ACLS standard of $1 \\mathrm { m g } \\mathrm { I V }$ to 0.1 mg IV.

    "explanation": "Poison ivy dermatitis goes by many names including allergic or atopic dermatitis and Toxicodendron dermatitis. While it originates from the same family as poison sumac, poison ivy is the most common cause of the dermatological condition in North America. Onset is typically delayed and presents after urushiol is absorbed and the body mounts an immune response. Irritant dermatitis may have a similar appearance to poison ivy dermatitis, but symptoms are typically more rapid in onset. Additionally, history can often be elicited to help distinguish between the two and is much less likely in old individuals. Herpes zoster is due to a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. While it follows a dermatomal distribution and may have a linear-like appearance, it is typically painful rather than pruritic and without an environmental cause. Poison sumac dermatitis will present similarly to poison ivy dermatitis, but its geographic distribution is primarily in the eastern portions of North America. Poison ivy has a much broader distribution and is found extensively throughout North America.",

    "explanation": "This is a case of Valproate Induced Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy (VIHE). This condition can occur in both toxic (acute/chronic) overdose or with therapeutic levels. VIHE should be considered in patients taking VPA and who appear altered/encephalopathic. Even in cases where toxicity (supratherapeutic VPA serum levels) is not suspected, this should not eliminate the possibility of VIHE provided toxicity can be secondary to both toxic and therapeutic plasma concentrations. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) competes with VPA plasma protein binding sites. This leads to the displacement and subsequent increase in VPA plasma concentrations leading to toxicity. VPA-induced encephalopathy is treated by discontinuation of VPA, Lcarnitine administration, and possibly extracorporeal treatment. For patients presenting with altered mental status and who are on VPA, a consideration for VIHE should be made.

    "explanation": "This patient has contacted the emergency services after sustaining a wound while on the beach. The description of a flatfish, with a long tail and presence of a barb in the wounds, suggests a stingray sting. Stingray stings mostly occur when an individual accidentally steps onto a buried stingray. Sting by the stingray is extremely pain full due to the presence of a preformed protein toxin in the tail barb. Patients often present with pain out of proportion to the wound. Immersing the affected area in hot water helps with pain relief. It has been postulated that immersion inactivates the protein toxin and leads to the improvement of pain. The water should be as hot as can be tolerated without causing burns. Once the water cools off, it should be replaced with hot water. This should be continued for 30-90 minutes. Other first aid management aspects include irrigating the wound and removal of stinger if visible. Covering the wound with mud and seaweed is a potential source of contamination.

    "explanation": "Metformin-associated lactic acidosis causes elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis by inhibiting Complex I of the mitochondrial respiration and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase leading to accumulation of pyruvate and decreased utilization of accumulated pyruvate in the Krebs cycle leading to increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactic dehydrogenase. Lactic acidosis occurs in metformin toxicity as it suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, where lactate is one of the substrates. Metformin promotes glucose-to-lactate conversion in the splanchnic bed of the small intestine. The patient's blood glucose is very low, consistent with metformin toxicity. He does not have salicylate toxicity as the respiratory compensation is adequate in this case (salicylate toxicity usually has combined elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis), and the wife also confirmed no over-the-counter medications.

Administration of other medications that compete for binding to albumin or inhibit warfarin's metabolism will markedly influence the anticoagulant effect. Clofibrate, and other highly protein-bound medications, can displace warfarin from albumin leading to an increased amount of free warfarin and increased anticoagulation and increased INR. Decreasing drug absorption and enhancing metabolism and clearance will lead to decreased warfarin effects and a low INR.",

Out of curiosity, they opened the package and found it contained several attractive mottled seeds about a couple of centimeters in size. They chewed on some of the seeds but spat them out soon owing to bitter taste. However, a few hours later, all of them developed a burning sensation in the mouth, followed by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The parents, who returned home a little while later, rushed the children to the hospital. Clinical examination shows signs of dehydration in all three children. Investigations reveal raised blood urea nitrogen and inorganic phosphate levels with hypoglycemia. All children are dehydrated, one of them very severely. The parents tell the attending physician that the children's grandfather was a retired government official who had worked with the government on a few terrorism-related cases while in office and that they suspect that the package which was intended for him from some unknown terrorist group, contained highly toxic seeds of a well-known plant.

    "explanation": "The suspected plant is Castor (Ricinus communis), which is commonly cultivated for its oil, but the seeds (1 to 2 cm in length, elliptical, glossy, and mottled black or brown) when chewed or crushed and swallowed, can cause severe gastroenteritis with hemolysis and renal failure. Ricin (the main active principle) has been used as a chemical warfare agent, a reagent for pepsin and trypsin, an experimental antitumor and immunosuppressive agent, and a commercial mole killer. Castor seeds are harmless when ingested whole since the outer coating resists digestion. However, if the seeds are crushed or chewed before swallowing, toxicity results due to the release of ricin. Poisoning is much more severe when ricin is injected parenterally. In severe cases, without appropriate supportive care, patients may die between 6 to 12 days post-ingestion due to peripheral vascular collapse and/or renal failure. Ingestion of five to 10 seeds is required to produce a fatal outcome. An estimated lethal dose in a child is approximately one to three seeds. A single seed is more likely to cause death due to anaphylaxis than due to toxic effects.",

    "explanation": "Cardenolides are found in the bark, leaves, seeds, or fruits of the yellow oleander. The most common type of cardenolide found is thevetin-A and thevetin-B. Thevetin-A shares a similar structural homology to the cardenolides derived from Digitalis Purpurea. Due to the shared structural homology, DIF can be used in the management of yellow oleander poisoning. DIF binds to thevetin-A and thevetin-B, preventing it from binding to myocyte sodium-potassium ATPases. This results in the reversal of symptoms of cardiotoxicity. The clinical symptoms and EKG findings in this patient are indicative of mild to moderate yellow oleander poisoning. Clinical signs of severe poisoning include a second or third-degree heart block and ventricular fibrillation. Gastrointestinal symptoms tend to occur secondary to local effects and central stimulation. However, cardiotoxicity appears as a result of inhibition of myocyte sodium-potassium ATPase pumps. Cross-reactivity exists between digoxin and other plant-derived cardiac glycosides. This forms the basis of administering DIF in plant-based cardiac glycoside intoxications such as Acokanthera oblongifolia, Adonis microcarpa (pheasants eye), Asclepias physocarpa (balloon cotton bush), Bryophyllum tubiflorum (mother of millions), Calotropis Procera (kings crown), Carissa laxiflora, Cerbera manghas (sea-mango), Cryptostegia Grandiflora (rubber-vine), Nerium oleander, Thevetia peruviana (yellow oleander), Indian hemp and Cerbera odollam (PongPong seeds).",

    "explanation": "The antiemetic and appetite-stimulating effects of the CB1 receptor are believed to mediate the therapeutic effects of dronabinol. In chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antiemetics, the recommended starting adult dosage is 5 mg orally 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy, followed by 5 mg every 2 to 4 hours (for a total of 4 - 6 doses in a day). The first dose should be on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before eating). The following doses can be taken with or without meals. Similar to dosing for anorexia, elderly patients may be started in a lower dose of $2 . 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ once daily prior to chemotherapy to reduce CNS symptoms.

Patients may typically report a strong \"rotten egg\" smell; however, it is important to note that hydrogen sulfide rapidly desensitizes olfactory nerves, and after prolonged exposure, patients may fail to recall the malodorous scent. The patient is presenting with hydrogen sulfide toxicity. The first-line treatment is supplemental oxygen, which is most effective when given via a high-flow nasal cannula. Hydrogen sulfide causes inhalation injury to the lung causing proteinaceous material to build up in the alveoli. Sodium nitrite should be strongly considered in this patient as he is in respiratory distress and is exhibiting some neurological signs of toxicity, such as headache and dizziness. Oxygen should be the first-line treatment, however, in the setting of tachypnea or hypoxia, which are always seen before or in conjunction with neurological symptoms. Cobinamide has been studied in vitro and has shown benefits in both hydrogen sulfide and cyanide toxicity. It remains under investigation, and while there may be no harm in giving it to very sick patients, it is not a first-line treatment.

    "explanation": "Grapefruit is a well-known irreversible inhibitor of multiple CYP450 enzymes that are essential for metabolizing drugs in the liver. Warfarin is mainly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19. One glass of grapefruit juice can irreversibly inhibit the CYP450 system for up to three days. With decreased metabolism of the drug, the patient may experience a more pronounced effect, as evidenced by supratherapeutic INR. There is some evidence that grapefruit juice could affect absorption; however, this is still debated and is not the major mechanism for the increased INR in this patient.",

Both groups exhibited decreased testicular mass at the end of ten weeks. Which cofactor(s) would have aided this toxic compound's phase I transformation process?",
    "options": [
      "a. Coenzyme A",

      "d. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)"
    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Zinc and NAD $+$",
    "explanation": "The male mice in this investigation were most likely exposed to a glycol ether such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Glycol ethers can be absorbed via inhalation through toxic fumes (occupational exposure) and the gastrointestinal tract. Upon absorption, glycol ethers are primarily metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and, to a lesser degree, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as part of the phase I transformation. ADH uses the cofactors zinc and niacin. Niacin (a precursor vitamin) produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $( \\mathrm { N A D + } )$ , which is used by ALD to carry out the redox reaction. An appropriate level of these two cofactors is essential in metabolizing glycol ethers. Glycol ether toxicity can result in neurotoxicity, anemia, and reproductive side effects. The mice exhibiting behavioral change suggested neurotoxicity after exposure to the vapor, hemolytic anemia due to membrane fragility, and testicular atrophy. Coenzyme A (CoA) is a cofactor for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is part of glycolysis, not drug metabolism. NADH is the reduced version of $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ , produced due to the redox reaction by ADH. Therefore, increased $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ would promote ALD function, not NADH. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a cofactor used in many metabolic pathways and enzymes, such as the electron transport chain, synthesis of CoA, and amino acid breakdown. And although ALD may use FAD to facilitate the redox reaction, the enzyme would better be served by the cofactors zinc and $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ . The cytochrome P450 system is also a significant part of phase I metabolism. Various enzymes in this system use $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ to metabolize compounds such as glycol ethers. However, glycol ethers would primarily be metabolized by ADH. Moreover, combining zinc and $\\mathrm { N A D + }$ would be more beneficial to phase I than either substance alone.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Ingestion of 50 capsules of diphenhydramine 2 hours prior to evaluation",
    "explanation": "While the classic administration timeframe of activated charcoal (AC) is within 1 hour of ingestion, this cutoff should be extended for some substances. Substances with a large pill burden that may form bezoars, substances that undergo enterohepatic or enteroenteric recirculation, or substances that decrease gastrointestinal (GI) motility such as anticholinergics or opioids may benefit from AC administration up to 4 hours after ingestion. Diphenhydramine has anticholinergic properties and would likely still have a substantial amount of xenobiotic within the GI tract. Activated charcoal should not be administered for the ingestion of substances in nontoxic doses. A 2.6-gram overdose of acetaminophen would be below the toxic dose threshold for acute acetaminophen ingestion. The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology states that AC administration is contraindicated when there is emesis or a high risk of aspiration. Although activated charcoal can be administered up to 4 hours after ingestion in these cases, studies suggest that the magnitude of the effect decreases over time. Some recent trials have not found activated charcoal administration to be beneficial. Although AC may decrease drug exposure, it may not lead to clinical benefits.",

    "explanation": "Bronchial asthma is managed using oral corticosteroids and either inhaled or oral beta-2 agonists. Anxiety, tachycardia, hypotension, and tremor are signs of non-selective sympathetic overstimulation, which can be caused by beta-2 agonist toxicity. B2 receptor activity is dependent on the structure of Gs protein; it is activated when bound to GTP and inactivated when bound to GDP. B2 agonists achieve their effects by stabilizing the Gs-GTP form, so it becomes more abundant than the B2 inactivated form Gs-GDP. In the case of toxicity, Gs-GTP increases in the number, and physiological equilibrium is lost, and in order to regain equilibrium, the Gs-GDP form should regain its concentration. This can be achieved by giving beta-blockers to stabilize the Gs-GDP form and antagonizing the overdose of B2 agonists.",

The gyromitra mushroom contains the substance gyromitrin, which is metabolized to monomethylhydrazine (MMH) after ingestion. MMH inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase, the enzyme responsible for transforming dietary vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) into active pyridoxal 5- phosphate, an important cofactor in GABA formation. Low levels of GABA result in a relative excitatory state in the brain, leading to delayed and refractory seizures. This inhibition of vitamin B6 activation is a similar mechanism of action to the anti-tuberculosis medication isoniazid. Similarly, the treatment is pyridoxine $2 5 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ intravenously. Midazolam does not work at the GABA receptor in the absence of adequate GABA, which is dependent on the availability of pyridoxine. Although many other drug classes can cause seizures, the other answer choices act by mechanisms of the sodium-channel blockade, direct GABA inhibition, or catecholamine release, which differs from the interference of GABA formation caused by both isoniazid and gyromitrin.",

For healthcare workers, this limit is 5,000 mrem. Since there is no safe level, exposure should be reduced to a point that is economical and practical, even if it exceeds the NRC regulations. The inverse square law does illustrate that putting distance between the worker and the source can reduce exposure. However, it is not the guiding principle in this case. ALARA (\"as low as reasonably achievable\") in the context of radiation safety takes into consideration the recommendations of the regulatory bodies, scientific evidence, and the means available to the facility to minimize the risks to a point that is economically feasible even if it is far below the recommended exposure limits.

The first line agent used in treating ischemic (low flow) priapism is phenylephrine (pure alpha-1 agonist) delivered via injection into the corpus cavernosa. Phenylephrine causes local vasoconstrictive effects via the alpha-1 agonistic effects and also causes an increased venous return from the penis in ischemic priapism. Because phenylephrine is locally injected in the case of priapism and because it is a pure alpha-1 agonist, the risk of cardiac or other systemic effects is minimized. In the case of ischemic priapism, beta or alpha-2 adrenergic effects are undesirable and are largely avoided by using the local dose of phenylephrine.",

    "answer": "c. The sublingual nitroglycerin delivered in the ambulance yielded a higher   \nbioavailability than the oral nitroglycerin prescription",
    "explanation": "Sublingual nitroglycerin bypasses intestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism by immediately diffusing into the bloodstream. It is commonly used to manage acute anginal pain. Avoiding the barriers of intestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism allows a larger fraction of a drug to enter the systemic circulation. Oral nitroglycerin must be absorbed into the intestines and subsequently metabolized in the liver in a process called the first-pass metabolism, which yields a slower onset of therapeutic effect, although more sustained. It is used for the chronic management of anginal pain. Sublingual nitroglycerin is the most appropriate initial route of administration for symptomatic relief of acute angina.

Several opioids have been adulterated with xylazine for various reasons, including cost savings, extending the length of the high opioids provide, and increasing the bulk of the opioids. Xylazine causes symptoms such as bradycardia and hypotension that do not respond to naloxone, an opioid reversal agent. The presence of xylazine can be confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This sensitive test can detect even minimal concentrations of xylazine in the blood and urine. However, this test takes longer to yield results. Xylazine is metabolized quickly and can appear in urine within an hour. Xylazine is not detected in a routine urine drug screen, which uses an immunoassay technique to test for the most common substances of abuse, including opioids, cannabinoids, amphetamines, cocaine, and phencyclidine (PCP). Therefore, repeating a urine drug screen will not help in this scenario. Prescription opioid monitoring panels detect other substances like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain opioids but cannot detect xylazine. As xylazine is not an opioid, it is not expected to be found in a more comprehensive blood opioid screen. Recently, research has been conducted to develop an immunoassaybased xylazine test strip for rapid detection; however, these are used by patients with substance use disorder to test their drug supply for the presence of xylazine and have no role in the healthcare setting.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Activated charcoal",
    "explanation": "Barbiturates are positive modulators of the GABA-A receptors and act by binding to sites distinct from benzodiazepine binding sites. Binding increases the duration of chloride channel opening, allowing chloride ions to enter the brain cells and leading to increased negative charges, and altering the voltage in the brain. The change in voltage makes the cells resistant to impulses and thus depresses them. Benzodiazepines act on GABA-A chloride ion channels as well. However, their mechanism of action is to increase the frequency, not duration, of chloride channel opening. Flumazenil is an appropriate treatment for an overdose of benzodiazepine. The toxic dose of barbiturates varies. However, an oral dose of $1 \\mathrm { { g } }$ for most barbiturates can cause significant poisoning in an adult. Fatal cases of ingestion have occurred with doses ranging between 2.0 and $1 0 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ . The usual lethal blood level ranges from 40 to $8 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ .

Interstitial inflammation, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis is consistent with viral pneumonia. Increase in size and number of small fenestrae in alveolar walls, breakdown and merging of fibrovascular trabeculae, and remodeling of acini results in airspace enlargement is consistent with emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid",
    "explanation": "Dimercaprol (BAL) was the primary chelating agent for metals such as arsenic, mercury, gold, and copper for several decades and is still stocked by hospital pharmacies. It is administered by deep intramuscular injection in the buttocks, which is painful, and associated with many side effects. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a water-soluble analog of dimercaprol that is given orally. DMSA has a larger therapeutic window and less toxicity than dimercaprol. Since becoming FDA-approved, there have been many case reports supporting DMSA as the preferred chelating agent in mercury poisoning. Penicillamine is only FDA-approved for the treatment of Wilson disease and cystinuria. Before its development, dimercaprol (BAL) was used as a chelating agent in the treatment of Wilson disease. Urine mercury concentration is a good diagnostic marker for mercury toxicity. A concentration ${ \\scriptstyle > 1 0 0 } \\mu \\mathbf { g } / \\mathrm { L }$ produces neurological signs, and a concentration ${ \\scriptstyle > 8 0 0 } \\mu \\mathbf { g } / \\mathrm { L }$ reduces the chance of survival significantly without chelation.",

They are one of the important reef builders in tropical oceans. Many corals, like Zoanthid corals, also known as soft corals, are very popular components of aquariums (home or public) due to their beauty and low maintenance. Species of Zoanthid corals like Palythoa and Zoanthus species can contain a highly toxic and potentially lethal chemical compound known as Palytoxin. Coral toxicity, therefore, is palytoxin toxicity. Palytoxin exposure, and resulting toxicity via coral, are mostly associated with inhalation of vapors during cleaning, scrubbing, or eradicating the coral from home or public aquariums.

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Centruroides grade I",
    "explanation": "The sting of a Centruroides scorpion causes primarily neurological symptoms, so tapping at the sting site worsens the paresthesia. The tap test is utilized in patients with grade I or lower grade envenomations, where they are less likely to produce obvious or gross symptoms. The tap test is not indicated in grade III or IV envenomations, where signs and symptoms are obvious and/or gross. Mesobuthus, Tityus, and Leiurus species cause severe cardiovascular symptoms and are not endemic to the United States. The FDA has approved Centruroides scorpion antivenom for bark scorpion stings. This antivenom can resolve the neurotoxic syndrome associated with these envenomations. Serum sickness or side effects can occur up to 14 days after its administration. Slow intravenous administration over at least 10 minutes is advisable. Close observation for up to an hour is necessary, and repeat doses may be necessary 30 to 60 minutes after the initial bolus. The adult and pediatric dosages are three vials intravenously over 10 minutes diluted, with possible repeat dosages of one vial every 30 to 60 minutes.

    "explanation": "Past exposure to Agent Orange and its most toxic element, 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), is associated with a broad range of complications. The complications with the strongest association to Agent Orange exposure include Parkinson disease, hypertension, soft tissue sarcomas, and Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, and chronic lymphocytic lymphomas. The National Academy of Medicine was tasked by the United States Congress in 1991 to evaluate the health impacts of herbicide use in Vietnam on veterans. This was last updated in 2018 \"Veterans and Agent Orange, Update 11\", which reviewed the available literature on health complications that may be associated with Agent Orange exposure. Studies conducted on populations in Agent Orange-affected regions, including Vietnam and Cambodia, have reported an increased incidence of congenital anomalies in the offspring of individuals exposed to Agent Orange.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH)",
    "explanation": "Intravenous ethanol is given to this patient with methanol poisoning (the main constituent of windshield washer fluid). Methanol is acted upon by alcohol dehydrogenase to convert it into 'formaldehyde.' Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH), in turn, acts on formaldehyde to convert it into formic acid, and this metabolite brings about the harmful effects of methanol poisoning such as vision loss and Parkinsonian movements. Since ethanol gets metabolized by ADH, its affinity for the former is significantly higher than methanol. Hence, ethanol administration results in a competitive inhibition of methanol, slowing down the formation of formic acid. Ethanol is metabolized by an oxidative as well as through a nonoxidative pathway. Various enzymes play a role in the oxidative pathway. They are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (present in the cytosol), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (present in mitochondria), cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) (present in microsomes), and catalase (present in peroxisomes). The non-oxidative pathway includes the enzymes, fatty acid ethyl ester synthase (FAEES), and phospholipase D (PLD). Both of these pathways are interrelated since drugs inhibiting the enzymes in the oxidative pathway drive the metabolism through the non-oxidative pathway.",

    "explanation": "Castor beans, from the castor plant Ricinus communis, naturally contain ricin, a carbohydrate-binding protein that is toxic when inhaled, ingested, or injected. Ricin exerts its toxic effect by irreversibly binding and inactivating ribosomes, disrupting protein synthesis, which results in endothelial cell damage. Symptoms from ricin ingestion can be non-specific, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurring within a few hours of ingestion. Hemorrhagic gastritis and bloody diarrhea can also occur, though less common. Elevated liver enzymes are commonly seen, except for mild cases. Acute kidney injury can occur. Treatment is supportive with aggressive fluid hydration and electrolyte repletion. Patients should also be monitored for delayed liver and other end-organ failure. N-acetylcysteine is used for acetaminophen toxicity. Although the patient has elevated liver enzymes, this is likely due to the castor bean ingestion, as the patient has no history of acetaminophen ingestion. Urinary alkalinization is used for salicylate overdose.

    "explanation": "Magnesium toxicity most commonly presents as nausea and vomiting. While these symptoms are vague, diminished deep tendon reflexes found on physical exam and hypotension on vital signs should raise suspicion for hypermagnesemia. Additionally, this patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, so the likelihood of him having undiagnosed chronic kidney disease is high. In this context, the use of laxatives, which contain magnesium, can predispose patients to magnesium toxicity due to poor renal clearance. Magnesium levels must be checked to evaluate the severity of the toxicity. Practitioners should also rule out other electrolyte abnormalities that can present similarly to magnesium toxicity. While a UA helps evaluate for diabetic ketoacidosis, which can also present with nausea and vomiting, this patient has diminished deep tendon reflexes, which would be more consistent with magnesium toxicity.

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Creatinine $2 . 8 \\ : \\mathrm { m g / d L }$",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the presence of an acute kidney injury, as demonstrated by this patient's increase in creatinine from a baseline within normal limits to $2 . 8 \\ : \\mathrm { m g / d L }$ . Approximately $7 0 – 8 0 \\%$ of baclofen is eliminated renally as an unchanged drug. The remainder is largely eliminated unchanged in feces. Therefore, acute kidney injury can precipitate baclofen toxicity despite therapeutic use. This patient should be managed with supportive care and treatment of his acute kidney injury. His baclofen dose should be decreased or stopped until his mental status, and kidney function returns to baseline. However, caution is necessary in cases of chronic high-dose baclofen use as the abrupt cessation of baclofen can precipitate acute withdrawal. Low albumin is less likely to cause toxicity as baclofen is only $30 \\%$ protein-bound. Elevated LFTs (implying liver dysfunction) are less likely to cause baclofen toxicity as it is primarily metabolized through the kidneys. An elevated acetaminophen level, as in this case, would be expected to cause liver dysfunction, which could indirectly lead to confusion and somnolence from hyperammonemia. However, such hepatotoxicity would not be expected within one day of acute ingestion, and his physical exam would also likely demonstrate scleral icterus, jaundice, and asterixis.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels",
    "explanation": "Phenytoin toxicity is characterized by nystagmus, dysarthria, confusion, ataxia, and irritability. Many other antiseizure medications can have similar symptoms, but gingival hyperplasia makes phenytoin the most likely medication in this scenario. Phenytoin's only mechanism of action is blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, which stabilizes the inactive state of the sodium channel and prolongs the neuronal refractory period. Many other antiepileptics have more than 1 mechanism. Phenytoin acts on the sodium channels in both neuronal and cardiac tissue. In the central nervous system, it targets neurons with highfrequency activity (as observed in seizures), with the majority of its actions in the motor cortex. This prevents the spread of a seizure's focal point and reduces the activity of brainstem regions responsible for the tonic phase of a tonic-clonic seizure. Examples of drugs that activate high-voltage calcium channels include phenobarbital, lamotrigine, topiramate, and levetiracetam. Drugs that activate low-voltage calcium channels include ethosuximide, sodium valproate, and zonisamide. Examples of GABA receptor agonists (not antagonists) include phenobarbital and benzodiazepines.",

Patients prescribed antipsychotic drugs with anticholinergic activity alongside other anticholinergic drugs, such as trihexyphenidyl, are at risk for toxicity. These patients can appear to be presenting with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS); however, NMS presents with muscle rigidity. Careful evaluation of symptoms and diagnosis is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis. Adequate airway patency should immediately be established. Physostigmine is a specific antagonist that acts centrally and peripherally to counter the antimuscarinic effects of trihexyphenidyl. Physostigmine is not currently available. Rivastigmine and pyridostigmine have been proposed as alternatives but are not approved for this indication. Convulsions and hyperactivity should be managed with diazepam, but with caution, as the risk of central nervous system depression can be exacerbated. Atonic bladder and bowel can be managed with carbachol.",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Localizing numbers of voltage-gated sodium channels to specifically the demyelinated segment of the axon.",
    "explanation": "The membrane action potential dissipates within a shorter distance in demyelinated neurons than in both normal myelinated and unmyelinated neurons. Normal unmyelinated neurons have voltage-gated sodium channels localized throughout their whole length to prevent action potential dissipation. In demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the function can be recovered either by axonal remyelination or by replicating the strategy of unmyelinated axons by localizing voltage-gated sodium channels throughout the demyelinated axon. The soma, or cell body, of a neuron, contains the nucleus. The soma connects to dendrites, which bring information to the neuron, and the axon, which sends information to other neurons. Dendrites are branched protoplasmic extensions of a neuron that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the soma from which the dendrites project. Increasing voltage-gated sodium channels within the soma and dendrites do not affect action potential propagation along the axon.",

The risk of significant bleeding in patients taking warfarin is proportional to the degree of anticoagulation as well as the presence of patient comorbidities. Some of these risk factors are modifiable and addressing modifiable risk factors may ultimately reduce the risks of both bleeding and thrombosis. Major classes of modifiable factors include patient comorbidities (e.g., heart failure), acute illnesses (e.g., infections, gastrointestinal illness), medication interactions (e.g., antibiotics, NSAIDs, anti-ulcer medications), and vitamin K intake. Many bleeding events in patients receiving warfarin occur in the setting of a therapeutic rather than supratherapeutic INR even if their baseline INR has been stable for months. These include increased age, female gender, concomitant use of medications like NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, antibiotics, amiodarone, statins, or a fibrate, history of recent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, blood dyscrasias, malignancy, anemia or poor drug compliance.

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Methylene blue",
    "explanation": "This infant most likely has developed methemoglobinemia. Infants under 4 months of age have reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) methemoglobin reductase (also known as cytochrome b5 reductase) activity, the main enzyme responsible for reducing methemoglobin, making them more susceptible than adults to oxidant stress. Well water contaminated by nitrates from farm fertilizer can cause methemoglobinemia and has been associated with infant fatalities. Symptoms are due to impaired oxygen-carrying capacity and its delivery to tissue. Methylene blue treatment is not required if the patient is asymptomatic. With methemoglobinemia, a pulse oximeter will overestimate oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gas analysis will show a normal pO2 level. Treatment of methemoglobinemia includes removing the inciting agent and considering the antidote methylene blue. High-flow oxygen delivered by a nonrebreather mask increases oxygen delivery to tissues. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) may benefit patients who fail methylene blue therapy. HBO therapy theoretically allows dissolved oxygen time to protect the patient while endogenous methemoglobin reduction occurs. However, HBO is not considered first-line therapy.

    "explanation": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a syndrome of altered mental status, autonomic instability, hyperthermia, and \"lead pipe\" rigidity associated with the use of certain medications. NMS is most commonly secondary to dopaminergic antagonists but, more rarely, can occur due to withdrawal from dopaminergic medications. Haloperidol and fluphenazine, both first-generation neuroleptic agents, are most commonly associated with NMS. However, NMS can also occur with second-generation or \"atypical\" neuroleptic agents such as risperidone. Risk factors for the development of NMS include high doses of neuroleptic medications, recent or rapid escalation in dosing, a switch from one agent to another, and parenteral administration. The treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is largely supportive and includes maintenance of euvolemia and normothermia as well as prevention of complications, which include deep venous thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In cases of severe muscle rigidity not improved with supportive measures, dantrolene and bromocriptine can be used. The distinguishing feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is the classic \"lead pipe\" rigidity. This can help distinguish NMS from other conditions that present with altered mental status, including sepsis, serotonin syndrome, sympathomimetic toxicity, anticholinergic syndrome, salicylate overdose, and thyrotoxicosis.",

    "explanation": "Immediately following a snakebite, a patient should be encouraged to remain calm and remain well hydrated with clear fluids if they can tolerate fluids by mouth. Agitation can worsen envenomation by raising the patient's heart rate and increasing blood circulation. Any tight garments, laces, or constricting jewelry should be removed. A tourniquet increases tissue pressure and tissue damage. It should never be performed for North American snake bites; some neurotoxic snakes in Asia and Australia are treated with a loose lymphatic tourniquet in those instances to retain the neurotoxin at the envenomation site. Ice can cause damage to the wound and should be avoided. Except in the rare instance of an intravascular envenomation, there is time to get to a health care facility for treatment calmly. Tight-fitting clothing should be loosened.",

It classically presents with minor pain at the site of the sting, followed by severe systemic symptoms, usually within 30 minutes, including severe back pain, abdominal pain, diffuse muscle cramping, diaphoresis, anxiety, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, and headache. A sense of “impending doom” has been documented to occur in the scientific literature. Although there are up to 25 cnidarian species implicated in causing Irukandji syndrome, it is most notably caused by the species Carukia barnesi, which is the first species documented in the literature to have caused this syndrome. Irukandji syndrome was originally found to occur along Australia’s northern coastline, but documented reports have occurred throughout the world including waters near the United States, Thailand, and the Caribbean. The site stung by Irukandji-causative jellyfish often appears unremarkable and is usually characterized by minor pain prior to the onset of systemic symptoms.

Baclofen overdose can present with bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, CNS depression, decreased respiratory drive, and paradoxical seizures in significant overdose. Up to $8 5 \\%$ of the drug is excreted through the renal system. Therefore, this patient with an acute kidney injury and an intrathecal baclofen pump is most likely suffering from unintentional baclofen toxicity. Hemodialysis can be used in cases of severe baclofen overdose, as it is largely renally cleared and a dialyzable substance. Proving oral baclofen or refilling the intrathecal baclofen pump would further worsen this patient's case of baclofen toxicity. Providing oral baclofen or refilling the pump would be appropriate for patients with suspected baclofen withdrawal. Intrathecal pumps will alarm when the pump needs to be refilled, is empty, or is unable to function properly. Pumps need to be maintained, evaluated, and refilled by specialists. Removing the pump at this time would be premature and take too much time for this patient undergoing severe toxicity. The pump should be paused if possible by a specialist.

    "explanation": "Nodes of Ranvier are critical for appropriate communication between the CNS and PNS, including motor activity and proper internal organ function. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a biotoxin that can interrupt propagation of action potentials at nodes of Ranvier but does not present with clear biomarkers on standard blood chemistry panels. Disruption of propagation at nodes of Ranvier can cause weakness, paralysis, paresthesia, respiratory arrest, and seizures. Especially without supportive care, TTX toxicity can cause death. Many of these symptoms stem from the attenuation of CNS-to-PNS signals mediated by nodes of Ranvier. Interruption of the activity of nodes of Ranvier can reduce action potentials relating to both sensory and motor signaling.",

    "answer": "a. Rocuronium 1 mg/kg IV",
    "explanation": "Laryngospasm is an uncommon complication from ketamine administration but is one of the most feared adverse events. Treatment for laryngospasms includes hyperextending the patient's neck, administration of oxygen to ensure appropriate oxygenation, and, in severe cases, administration of a paralytic agent that will cause muscle relaxation, allowing for appropriate airway management through endotracheal intubation. The use of ketamine has a potential complication of laryngospasm. Multiple studies have shown no evidence of association with age, dose, or other clinical factors that contribute to ketamine-associated laryngospasm. Rapid identification and management of this idiosyncratic effect are paramount for prehospital providers, including the use of paralytic agents in severe cases to stop the laryngospasms. Stridor is caused by the closure of the vocal cords secondary to spasms of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles (cricothyroid and posterior cricoarytenoid). Rocuronium or other paralytic agents causing smooth muscle relaxation is the primary treatment modality for patients with severe laryngospasm related to ketamine administration.

A comprehensive medication history is vital for any patient taking MAOIs. Linezolid is one of the antibiotics that may interfere and result in MAOI toxicity. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors can have clinical effects for up to 2 to 3 weeks after stopping the medication. Even if the patient in this question was not taking phenelzine while admitted for ten days, her body has not yet had enough time to synthesize new monoamine oxidase. Monoamine oxidase toxicity has the potential to go unrecognized due to its nonspecific signs and symptoms. In this vignette, if the patient were to be prescribed linezolid and developed fever and altered mental status, a physician could assume she is developing a worsening infection instead of MAOI toxicity.

First and second-generation antihistamines block H1 receptors on mast cells, but they are also found in the heart and brain as well. The over-the-counter medicine associated with sedation, dry mouth, and muscle stiffness is most likely a first-generation antihistamine. Secondgeneration antihistamines are better tolerated than the first generation. Promethazine is a strong first-generation antihistamine. It acts on the H1-receptor as an antagonist, which the patient most likely has ingested.

    "explanation": "This patient has Tetralogy of Fallot and was placed on calcium channel blockers (CCBs) due to potential rhythm disturbances after the surgery. She overdosed on this medication and already exhibited toxicity when she was found. CCBs interfere with insulin secretion which leads to hyperglycemia. Hemodynamic effects are bradycardia, hypotension, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. This often fatal ingestion requires prompt, aggressive, and multimodal treatment, much of which can have minimal effect in massive intakes. Vasopressors and ECMO are often lifesaving in these extreme cases. Glucagon, vasopressors, and cardiac pacing would be most appropriate for a beta-blocker overdose. Beta-blockers also interfere with gluconeogenesis, usually leading to hypoglycemia. This patient has hyperglycemia. Sodium bicarbonate, intralipid, urine alkalinization would be most appropriate for an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

In a closed room, burning can cause a sufficient amount of CO to build up and result in carbon monoxide poisoning. The etiology of CO toxicity is due to its effect on oxygen binding to the hemoglobin molecule. CO binds to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) with a $2 2 0 \\%$ greater affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen. This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and leads to cellular hypoxia. The cornerstone of treatment for CO poisoning is supplemental oxygen that should be initiated as soon as possible and continued throughout treatment.

This medication is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 and can result in decreased metabolism of the TCAs, potentiating their toxicity. The co-ingestion of other anticholinergic medications may cause more erratic absorption.

    "explanation": "Cone snails include over 500 different species of predatory snails. While humans are not the intended prey for these mollusks, naive divers may inadvertently pick up cones with the intention of keeping them as souvenirs. People that are stung by a cone snail are often subject to a venom potent enough to paralyze and eventually kill its prey immediately. Cone snail venom is a complex mixture of compounds that cause paralysis through multiple neuromuscular blocking steps. The effects of envenomation vary based on the specific peptides within the venom, and these toxins have a variety of neuromuscular effects through glutamate, adrenergic, serotonin, and cholinergic pathways. The initial symptoms of envenomation vary; one may feel anything from a sharp pricking sensation to unbearable pain. At the envenomation site, local numbness, ischemia, cyanosis, and necrosis may occur and sometimes involves entire regions of the body. Given that the affected neurotransmitter pathways exist throughout the body, systemic symptoms may develop. They can manifest from initial weakness, sweating, and visual changes to generalized muscle paralysis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and coma. If a patient is untreated, death is rapid and often occurs within one to five hours. When cone snail envenomation occurs, the patient should be transported as soon as possible to the nearest emergency department for respiratory and circulatory stabilization.",

He is treated with escalating doses of atropine and an appropriate dose of pralidoxime approximately 30 minutes after exposure. However, the victim's clinical condition did not improve, and the ineffectiveness of one of the treatments was suspected. To which of the following agents was this victim exposed?",

In this scenario, the victim was treated appropriately; however, given that aging has already occurred, the pralidoxime was not effective. This only occurs with Soman. In this scenario, the victim was most likely exposed to soman as this agent has an incredibly short aging time of only a few minutes. The remaining agents have longer times until aging, such as Sarin (about 5 hours) up to more than 40 hours for VX.

    "explanation": "This patient is brought to the emergency department from a burning building. He is unconscious, and there is soot around his nostrils, indicating smoke inhalation. His cherry-red appearance, along with metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate, raises the suspicion of cyanide toxicity. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is beneficial in cases of cyanide toxicity. Cyanine binds to the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and results in the uncoupling of the electron transport chain. This shifts the metabolism from an aerobic to an anaerobic state. The resultant cellular hypoxia contributes to the pathogenesis of cyanide toxicity. Hydroxycobalamin is the appropriate antidote that transforms the cyanide into cyanocobalamin, which is Vitamin B12. There is no indication for vitamin E in the treatment of cyanide toxicity. HBOT is often administered with other specific antidotes. Hydroxocobalamin bound to cyanide and facilitated its excretion. Amyl nitrite converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which binds cyanide. Thiosulfate provides a sulfur group, which then binds to cyanide leading to detoxification.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old man was hosting a party on a boat with several friends when he decided to jump into the ocean for a swim. He immediately felt pain throughout his body and swam back to the boat. Once on board, he began complaining of abdominal pain. He was noted to be diaphoretic and stated that his abdomen was cramping, and he had a headache. Thinking he had been exposed to the sun for too long, he decided to rest below deck. Meanwhile, two friends also decided to jump into the water. They both immediately felt pain; however, they were unable to see, even with their goggles, anything that may have bitten or stung them. Due to severe worsening pain, the decision was made to take them to the hospital. They were quickly diagnosed with Irukandji syndrome due to suspected jellyfish envenomation. Although the latter two swimmers had mild symptoms while in the hospital, the initial swimmer/host began to become agitated and decompensate. His vital signs reveal pulse 154/min, respiratory rate $3 6 / \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ , blood pressure 180/120 mmHg, temperature $3 6 \\mathrm { C }$ , and SpO2 $9 8 \\%$ on room air.

    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Intramuscular epinephrine",
    "explanation": "This patient who developed systemic symptoms of severe muscle cramps, headache, hypertension, and diaphoresis after a jellyfish sting, likely has the Irukandji syndrome. Up to 25 jellyfish species have been implicated in causing Irukandji syndrome with their stings, but the species Carukia barnesi is the most well-known. There is no specific antivenom for Irukandji Syndrome, so the treatment is mainly supportive. Although there exists an antivenom for stings by the deadly box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri, a related species of jellyfish, also in the Cubozoa class, there is no evidence that it is efficacious in treating Irukandji Syndrome. Furthermore, patients can develop an anaphylactic reaction to the antivenom, which likely occurred in this patient after he received the antivenom without improvement of his symptoms. For unclear reasons, either due to patterns of human activity or due to migratory patterns of Irukandji-causative species, stings from these species tend to occur in clustered outbreaks. It is not uncommon to see multiple patients presenting to a hospital with similar symptoms after jellyfish envenomations on the same day. Anaphylaxis must be immediately treated with IM epinephrine. The patient may require fluids if the patient develops shock secondary to the anaphylaxis. Antihistamines and steroids are often given in suspected anaphylaxis in conjunction with epinephrine. However, the mainstay of the treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine.",

    "answer": "c. Phospholipase A, which converts lecithin to lysolecithin, a hemolytic   \nagent.",
    "explanation": "Snake venom is a highly modified saliva that contains zootoxins that facilitate the immobilization and digestion of prey. Unique fangs inject it, and some species can spit. The glands that secrete the zootoxins are a modification of the parotid salivary gland and are situated on each side of the head, behind and below the eye, and encapsulated in a muscular sheath. The glands have alveoli in which the synthesized venom is stored before it is transferred by a duct to the base of tubular fangs through which it is ejected. Venoms contain more than 20 compounds, mostly proteins, phospholipases, and polypeptides. A complex mixture of enzymes, proteins, and other substances with toxic and lethal properties serves to immobilize the prey, enzymes play an important role in prey digestion, and other substances are responsible for important but non-lethal biological effects. Some of the proteins in snake venom have specific effects on blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and the muscular or nervous systems. Some have been developed for use as pharmacological or diagnostic tools, and many are useful drugs. Phospholipase A is a phospholipase contained in snake venom that removes a fatty acid from lecithin to yield lysolecithin, a powerful hemolytic agent. This is the best explanation for this patient's labs, which show clear evidence of hemolysis. Venomous snakes in the United States were previously classified as having either hemotoxic or neurotoxic venom, although more recent toxicology research suggests this binary classification is inadequate. The venom contains proteins, phospholipases, and enzymes that can cause necrosis and hemolysis via a variety of mechanisms that are still under study. A concomitant allergic response leading to the release of histamine and bradykinin may also contribute to the systemic effects seen in more severe envenomations. Hypotension after a snakebite is likely caused by a variety of mechanisms, including increased permeability of capillaries, leading to extravasation of plasma and direct effects of toxins on the cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and other tissues.",

    "answer": "a. Soft tissue sarcoma",
    "explanation": "Veterans who served in Vietnam and the Korean demilitarized zone between 1961 and 1971 may have been exposed to herbicides such as Agent Orange and are at increased risk of developing several malignancies, including soft tissue sarcomas. Other malignancies significantly associated with Agent Orange exposure include nonHodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. Laryngeal, bronchogenic, and bladder malignancies are associated with Agent Orange exposure to a lesser degree. One component of Agent Orange is the herbicide 2,4,5- trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). The byproduct of 2,4,5-T production is 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD is a known carcinogen and the most potent of the dioxins. TCDD and other dioxins are believed to affect the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an inducible transcription factor that impacts gene expression in many body tissues. TCDD is classified as a carcinogen and may induce heritable epigenetic changes in DNA. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare malignancies that tend to metastasize rapidly and have an overall poor prognosis. Examples of soft tissue sarcomas include angiosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and liposarcoma. Less differentiated neoplastic lines, such as epithelioid sarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, portend a worse prognosis.",

    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Pentobarbital",
    "explanation": "Pentobarbital works in the central nervous system by binding to gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) A subtype receptors. This induces a change in the chloride transport receptor channels that increase the duration these channels remain open, potentiating the effects of GABA. GABA is responsible for producing CNS depression. Pentobarbital does cross the blood-brain barrier and is a sedativehypnotic. The mechanism described above is the mechanism by which pentobarbital causes respiratory depression as demonstrated by this patient's respiratory rate of 6/min making it the most likely answer. Lipid-soluble medications, such as pentobarbital, are much more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier. The endothelial cells that make up the blood-brain barrier have astrocyte cells with projections that provide biochemical and mechanical support to this barrier. Neostigmine, dopamine, and guanethidine do not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus are not likely to exert respiratory depression as seen in this patient.",

Succinylcholine is the most common neuromuscular blocking agent given during RSI due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. Pseudocholinesterase is the enzyme that metabolizes succinylcholine. When patients have a deficiency in this enzyme and receive succinylcholine, its effect at the neuromuscular junction is prolonged and can result in weakness. This patient likely received succinylcholine during intubation and had pseudocholinesterase deficiency, which lead to prolonged muscle weakness, evidenced by the train-of-four ratio and need for ventilator support.

Under physiological conditions, there are only trace amounts of this molecule. 1,3-BPG is shunted off to produce 2,3-BPG, a pathway that neither consumes or produces ATP. 2,3-BPG binds to deoxyhemoglobin (the T-state) and stabilizes it. The binding collapses the center pocket of the deoxyhemoglobin and decreasing the affinity of oxygen to deoxyhemoglobin, causing the release of the oxygen. This allows oxygen availability and its uptake by the cells. Gluconeogenesis occurs during fasting/starvation state.

Sinus bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of less than 60/min with sinus rhythm. Sinus bradycardia can be physiological in well-conditioned athletes, young adults, and in some elderly patient populations. Pathological conditions include medications, hypothyroidism, sick sinus syndrome, myocardial ischemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and increased intracranial pressure. Galantamine is available as a supplement and has recently been used as an oneirogen, lucid dream inducer. It is available as a 4mg capsule in the market. Galantamine increases the duration of REM sleep (dream sleep), lucid dreaming, and recall of the dreams on awakening. The dosage of galantamine for lucid dreaming is on the low side, 4-12mg during sleep. This patient has recently used this supplement for a few days. Galantamine has increased vagal tone and inhibited sinoatrial node that has resulted in sinus bradycardia. In most cases, sinus bradycardia is asymptomatic, but some patients can manifest symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, fatigue, dyspnea, syncope, hypotension, angina, and congestive cardiac failure. The first step in managing this patient with symptoms involves discontinuing the offending agent galantamine, followed by intravenous administration of atropine as initial treatment of the bradycardia and hypotension. Atropine is anticholinergic and counteracts the pharmacological effects of galantamine on the heart. In case of inadequate response, further therapeutic options include intravenous epinephrine or dopamine, or pacing.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. A byproduct binds to cytochrome C oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.",
    "explanation": "Sodium nitroprusside is used in hypertensive emergencies and can lead to cyanide toxicity, especially when administered at high doses or for prolonged periods. When administered, sodium nitroprusside releases nitric oxide, which is responsible for its vasodilatory effect. Concurrently, it also releases cyanide ions as a byproduct. Cyanide ions rapidly diffuse into cells and bind with the ferric ion $( \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } )$ in the cytochrome C oxidase enzyme within the mitochondria. This enzyme is vital to the electron transport chain, which is responsible for aerobic ATP production.Binding of cyanide to cytochrome C oxidase halts the electron transport chain, inhibiting aerobic metabolism. As a result, cells shift to anaerobic metabolism, leading to inadequate ATP production and the accumulation of lactic acid, manifesting as metabolic acidosis.The inhibition of cellular respiration primarily affects organs with high oxygen demands, such as the brain and heart. Early signs include confusion, nausea, and tachypnea. Progression can lead to severe lactic acidosis, seizures, cardiovascular collapse, and death. Signs and symptoms begin at blood cyanide concentrations of approximately $4 0 \\mathrm { m o l / L }$ . In vivo, cyanide metabolism and neutralization involve several mechanisms. The most important of these is cyanide detoxification via rhodanese, an enzyme found abundantly in many tissues, especially the liver and muscle. Thiosulfate is a sulfur donor in the reaction catalyzed by rhodanese that converts cyanide to thiocyanate, a water-soluble molecule excreted in the urine. The treatment for cyanide toxicity involves agents that either detoxify cyanide ions or provide an alternative pathway for cellular respiration. Hydroxocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12, binds with cyanide ions to form cyanocobalamin, which is readily excreted. This reaction removes cyanide from cytochrome C oxidase, restoring the electron transport chain's function. Hydroxycobalamin is effective and can be used without laboratory confirmation of cyanide poisoning. It does not rely on the body's sulfur stores and is helpful in cases where sulfur donors (like thiosulfate) might be depleted.Sodium thiosulfate is a sulfur donor and reacts with cyanide to form thiocyanate, catalyzed by the enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is significantly less toxic than cyanide and is excreted in urine. It is effective in cases where the body's natural detoxification mechanisms are overwhelmed. It is often used in conjunction with other treatments, like hydroxocobalamin. In cases of suspected cyanide toxicity, especially when linked to sodium nitroprusside infusion, it is crucial to act quickly. The prompt administration of these antidotes can significantly improve the patient's outcome. To decrease the risk of cyanide toxicity, the duration and dose of sodium nitroprusside infusion should be limited, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity, especially during prolonged or high-dose infusions. Coadministration of sodium thiosulfate can be considered to detoxify cyanide ions.",

    "explanation": "The question stem describes acute flaccid paralysis (decreased muscle tone and strength) in the setting of the ingestion of shellfish with other symptoms suggestive of paralytic shellfish poisoning. Of the toxins listed, saxitoxin is related to paralytic shellfish poisoning. Saxitoxin acts by reversibly binding voltage-gated sodium channels of neurons resulting in flaccid paralysis similar to tetrodotoxin, as opposed to spastic paralysis seen in tetanus or strychnine toxicities. Tetrodotoxin, however, is found in species of pufferfish, blue ring octopus, horseshoe crab, and newt; it is not commonly found in shellfish. It is unlikely that the patient consumed tetrodotoxin. Saxitoxin is synthesized by dinoflagellates and is commonly associated with shellfish such as mussels, clams, oysters, and scallops. As opposed to ciguatoxin or tetrodotoxin, which are more commonly associated with other animals such as fish. Ciguatoxin causes the foodborne illness ciguatera, associated with eating reef fish contaminated with the toxin. Brevetoxins are found in filterfeeding shellfish and can cause paresthesias, myalgias, vertigo, ataxia, a reversal of hot and cold temperature sensations, headache, bradycardia, mydriasis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Neither of these is associated with paralysis.",

Buprenorphine, a partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist, can be combined with naloxone for effective therapy in medically supervised opioid withdrawal.

When crushed and intravenously injected, it can precipitate opioid withdrawal and lead to lacrimation, rhinorrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, and myalgias. To begin buprenorphine-naloxone therapy, mild-to-moderate withdrawal must be present to receive a net benefit for the opioid agonist component and relief from withdrawal symptoms. Mild-to-moderate withdrawal is confirmed by a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score greater than 10 or 12.

In acute iron toxicity, signs for deferoxamine include patients who are in shock, have iron concentrations over ${ \\mathrm { 5 0 0 ~ m c g / d L } }$ , significant iron ingestion, persistent vomiting, or an elevated gap metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in acute iron toxicity and can indicate severe toxicity.

When iron stores are saturated, iron will undergo a hydration reaction by which iron generates three protons, and thus acidosis occurs. This can lead to a very profound acidosis and is an important indicator that chelation with deferoxamine may be required. Metabolic alkalosis may result from vomiting, but it is not an indicator of chelation therapy. Peak serum levels of more than ${ \\mathrm { 5 0 0 ~ m c g / d L } }$ indicate the use of deferoxamine.

The most common cause of urushiol sensitization is poison ivy or Toxicodendron radicans. Toxicodendron is a genus of plants, shrubs, vines, and trees within the Anacardiaceae family. Common names of plants within the family include poison oak, poison ivy, poison sumac, and the Chinese lacquer tree. Initial management consists of immediate irrigation with soap and decontamination of clothing upon exposure. Metopium toxiferum is the scientific name for the poisonwood tree. While this tree also belongs to the same family as poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) it is primarily isolated to southern Florida in the Florida Keys and is much less likely the patient has encountered it.

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Ethylene glycol ingestion",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is with severe acidosis. In the evaluation of acid-base disorders, the anion gap should be calculated. Anion gap $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ sodium - (chloride $^ +$ bicarbonate), with a normal range of 8 to 12 mEq/L. The patient's anion gap is '31' $( 1 3 8 - [ 9 7 + 1 0 ] )$ ). He clearly has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and requires an evaluation of the cause. Any patient with a 'HAGMA' should have his or her osmolarity calculated and measured to evaluate the osmolar gap. Calculated osmolarity $= ( 2 \\mathrm { ~ x ~ s o d i u m } ) + ( \\mathrm { B U N } / 2 . 8 ) + ( \\mathrm { b }$ lood glucose/18). Osmolar gap $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity, with normal being less than or equal to $1 0 \\mathrm { m O s m / k g }$ . This equation assumes the values of BUN and glucose are reported in mg/dL. This patient has an osmolar gap of 31.6, based on a calculated osmolarity of approximately 293 mOsm/L $( [ 2 \\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 3 8 ] + [ 3 5 / 2 . 8 ] + [ 9 7 / 1 8 ] = 2 9 3 . 4 )$ and a measured osmolarity of $3 2 5 \\mathrm { \\ m O s m / L }$ . While the patient's measured value is grossly abnormal, the elevated osmolar gap suggests toxic alcohol ingestion instead of the ingestion of acetaminophen or salicylic acid. Of the various causes of a HAGMA, a minority also produce an elevated osmolar gap. These most often are limited to methanol and ethylene glycol. Differentiating these based on the direct measurement of serum levels can take up to a week when a reference laboratory must be used. Therefore, differentiation must be based on other factors. In this case, the patient has a urinalysis with crystals suggestive of calcium oxalate monophosphate (\"dumbbell-shaped\"). As ethylene glycol metabolized into oxalic acid, it can produce such crystals and is likely the cause of this patient's toxic ingestion. If the patient had presented with focal neurologic changes, especially visual or auditory changes, and no calcium oxalate crystals, methanol ingestion would be more likely. Given the severity of this patient's acidosis, he has likely presented a significant period of time after ingesting ethylene glycol likely in the form of anti-freeze. Treatment with fomepizole, while not necessarily inappropriate, will not prevent the development of acidosis; it is too late. Sodium bicarbonate would be an appropriate bridging therapy to initiation of hemodialysis but would not reverse the underlying issue. Treatment will require the removal of the toxic metabolites of ethylene glycol from the patient's blood via emergent hemodialysis.",

Inhibition of cAMP formation results in the inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic neuronal hyperpolarization, and reduced neuronal excitability. The treatment for this patient with opioid toxicity would be an opioid antagonist, such as naloxone. Opioid antagonists will lead to increased levels of cAMP by reversing the effects of opioid agonists. Naloxone, the highly competitive mureceptor antagonist, reverses the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, reverses the inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmitters' release, reverses the postsynaptic neuronal hyperpolarization, and reverses the reduced neuronal excitability.

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Chronic iron deficiency",
    "explanation": "Chronic Iron deficiency leads to elevated levels of transferrin. Transferrin can carry manganese in its $\\mathbf { M n } 3 +$ form. This transferrin-Mn complex can cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system causing early neuropsychiatric manifestations of manganism. The same mechanism occurs in the intestinal tract, whereby Mn transporter DMT-1 is upregulated. This leads to increased intestinal absorption of the metal and potentially to further preponderance of developing toxicity. Women are one of the most at-risk populations for the development of manganism due to their higher chance of developing iron deficiency due to abnormalities of menses. Risk factors for abnormal menstruation may include copper intrauterine devices and other hormonal imbalances, including ovulatory dysfunction; fibroids; vaginal, cervical, or uterine polyps; adenomyosis; endometrial hyperplasia, or malignancy. This patient should be adequately treated for chronic anemia, and the importance of iron supplementation should be discussed. Treatment should proceed with the removal of the patient from her source exposure to manganese (likely contaminated well-water), use of chelators including CaNa2EDTA (EDTA), or para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and potentially utilize novel therapies including taurine and other nutritional supplements.",

    "answer": "a. Sodium bicarbonate",
    "explanation": "Imipramine is a tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressant. Although it is an FDA approved for the treatment of depression, it is used as a second-line treatment due to its undesired side effects and due to its toxicity in overdose. Imipramine is used as adjunctive therapy in nocturnal enuresis in children above six years of age. There are off-label uses of imipramine as in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and panic disorder. Imipramine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Since imipramine is a tertiary amine, it has a greater affinity for the serotonin and it has more anticholinergic side effects. Therefore, this will lead to an increase the level of serotonin neurotransmitters in the synapse. Additionally, imipramine and other tricyclics have different effects on other receptors. It blocks antimuscarinic receptors, thus, producing anticholinergic adverse effects. It also blocks alpha 1 and 2 adrenergic and H1 receptors. The risk of developing toxicity from imipramine and other tricyclics is greater upon increasing the dose. An overdose of imipramine can result in serious side effects, mainly cardiac dysrhythmia, critical hypotension, convulsions, coma, confusion, hyperactive reflexes, and hypothermia. Imipramine has type 1 antiarrhythmic effects as it blocks the fast sodium channel on the myocardium. Therefore, this will lead to inhibition of depolarization of the heart action potential. This will result in QRS prolongation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Acute management must begin with an assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation in addition to ECG monitoring. Sodium bicarbonate will reverse the fast sodium channel function on the myocardium, which will reverse the cardiotoxicity and, at the same time, will raise the PH.",

    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Discharge with close outpatient follow-up if asymptomatic after 6 hours.",
    "explanation": "Castor beans, from the castor plant Ricinus communis, naturally contain ricin, a carbohydrate-binding protein that is toxic when inhaled, ingested, or injected. The degree to which ingested beans are chewed will affect the toxicity of oral ingestions. Fresh, soft seeds that are easily chewable are more likely to cause toxicity than older ones enveloped by a hard coat that are difficult to chew. Although deaths have been reported with ingestions of as little as 2 seeds, toxicity is unlikely if mature seeds are swallowed intact. Patients who remain asymptomatic after a 6-hour observation postingestion of a castor bean may be discharged with strict return precautions for the development of any symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Close outpatient follow-up, including Laboratory testing for delayed liver toxicity, is also appropriate. As the patient is asymptomatic, admission for serial bloodwork and aggressive fluid resuscitation is not appropriate at this time. Induction of vomiting with syrup of ipecac is generally not indicated for toxic ingestions and has fallen out of favor due to its major risks and findings of it being less effective at lowering total body poison concentrations than activated charcoal.",

    "explanation": "Bronchial asthma is a respiratory disease whose most common symptom is difficulty in breathing. Clinical examination during an acute attack shows high-frequency wheezes. Bronchoconstriction due to tissue inflammation, edema, and mucous oversecretion is the cause of the disease's signs and symptoms. Treatments for asthma are given to reduce inflammation and increase bronchial patency by relaxation of airway smooth muscles. Albuterol is a commonly prescribed drug for asthma. It targets beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which when activated, cause smooth muscle relaxation. Beta-2 receptors are naturally stimulated in the body by sympathetic hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, the former having the strongest agonistic effect on them. Epinephrine is secreted from the suprarenal glands. Norepinephrine is a sympathetic hormone which can stimulate beta-2 receptors, but less effective than epinephrine. Thyroxine is a metabolic hormone secreted by the thyroid gland and has no role in beta-2 receptor stimulation. Dopamine is a hormone and a neurotransmitter that has a low affinity for beta-2 receptors.",

Flumazenil can be helpful in reversing the effects of meprobamate in an overdose situation. Naloxone (competitive antagonism at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) reverse the effects of opioid medications only would not be expected to have an effect on a patient with carisoprodol overdose unless opioids were also used by the patient. Alkalinization of urine does not help with carioprodol overdose. Charcoal (adsorption of xenobiotics within the gastrointestinal tract) would not be expected to reverse somnolence within 2 minutes.",

    "explanation": "Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive and spore-forming organism found in the soil. It usually is transmitted by handling contaminated animals and animal products. Inhalational anthrax presents following an incubation period of approximately 1 to 6 days post-exposure, with a non-specific prodromal phase including fever, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, malaise, chest pain, and nonproductive cough. The second stage of illness occurs as bacterial replication in mediastinal lymph nodes results in hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis and progression to bacteremia. Chest x-ray classically demonstrates a widened mediastinum (the result of significant lymphadenopathy) without pulmonary infiltrates. However, pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates, both of which may be hemorrhagic, can be seen. Treatment for inhalational anthrax requires a multidrug regimen with 1 bactericidal agent plus 1 protein-synthesis inhibitor.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Transfer of long-chain fatty acids to mitochondria for subsequent betaoxidation.",
    "explanation": "As the patient has been diagnosed with valproate toxicity, she is given L-carnitine supplementation. Valproate-induced hyperammonemia and hepatotoxicity may be mediated in part by carnitine deficiency; carnitine supplementation may prevent and attenuate these adverse effects. Carnitine may expedite the resolution of coma, prevent hepatic dysfunction, and reverse mitochondrial metabolic abnormalities in patients with acute toxicity. L-carnitine is found in all mammalian tissue, which is important for lipid catabolism. It is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids to mitochondria for subsequent beta-oxidation. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes and displaces opioids at opioid receptor sites, but it is not a supplement. Increased availability of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter along with blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, is the mechanism of action of valproate. Inhibition of the metabolism of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase, thereby enhancing its cholinergic effects, and facilitating impulses across the myoneural junction is the mechanism of action of pyridostigmine used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.",

Activated charcoal is best for recent ingestion when taken within the last hour. Salicylate is a hydrocarbon and therefore susceptible to binding charcoal. If ingestion was recent, confirmed, or suspected toxic overdose (qty), and if the patient is not altered or an aspiration risk, activated charcoal can potentially reduce toxicity by limiting absorption. MultiDose Activated Charcoal (MDAC) can also be considered in cases of larger overdoses where pharmacological bezoars are suspected. MDAC can also be considered based on entero-hepatic recirculation principles, further reducing absorption. Alkalization of the urine is a common treatment used for salicylate toxicity due to its favorable pharmacokinetics relating to urinary pH manipulation to favor renal elimination. Salicylate is a weak acid and in conditions of increased alkalinity (increased pH), salicylate favors its charged state (conjugate base) by giving up a proton in an alkaline solution. With this knowledge, we can see how increasing the urinary pH using sodium bicarbonate infusions will favor the charged state of salicylate. The payout is that charged molecules do not cross the plasma membranes including the renal tubules/collection system of the kidneys; therefore, a significantly small fraction of uncharged salicylate crosses back into the bloodstream across the renal tubules, while a larger fraction is charged, and therefore trapped, and renally eliminated. Dialysis is used for persistent neurologic symptoms, renal failure, or pulmonary edema. It is also indicated if levels exceed $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / d L }$ in acute ingestion.",

The snake quickly swam away, and he was not able to get a good view of it or take a picture. He presents to a local emergency department 1 hour later, with 2 small bite wounds on his dorsal right hand and minimal pain and surrounding erythema. He otherwise denies symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, tingling around his mouth, or rigors. He is well-appearing and has normal vital signs. The appearance of the hand is unchanged since the injury.

      "d. Observation only"
    ],
    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Observation only",
    "explanation": "Only observation is warranted in this patient with minimal envenomation. It is estimated that $2 5 \\%$ of venomous snake bites do not result in envenomation. Moreover, this patient did not get a clear view of the snake that bit him, so it is unclear if the offending creature was a venomous species. Although not able to be identified, absolutely brown snakes in Georgia could be cottonmouths, whose envenomation is milder than rattlesnakes. Envenomation severity is classified into five grades (0 to IV), with grade IV being very severe envenomation characterized by rapidly progressing swelling, bleb formation, and necrosis as well as systemic symptoms including weakness, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramping, and convulsions. Minimal envenomation (grade 0) is characterized by fang wounds without other signs of envenomation and 1 inch of surrounding erythema, without systemic signs or symptoms of envenomation. The current treatment recommendation for crotalid (pit viper) envenomation is to use FabAV polyvalent antivenom. Dosing is largely based on the severity of symptoms at initial presentation and response to treatment. Treatment of moderate envenomation should start with at least 4 vials, then half that amount as a maintenance dose every 6 hours for 18 hours. Minimal envenomation does not require treatment with antivenom, but these patients should be monitored for a minimum of 12 to 14 hours. Surgical consultation is not warranted, as the patient is not displaying any signs of compartment syndrome. Administration of antivenom is not necessary in this case, as the patient has very minimal symptoms, consistent with minimal or grade I envenomation. Admission to the ICU would not be warranted in this stable patient with minimal, localized symptoms.",

    "explanation": "Depending on the dose, administration route, and coingestants, PCP can cause a wide spectrum of clinical effects, from a coma to extreme agitation or psychosis. Often, patients cannot give a clear history, so it is imperative to attempt to obtain a history from emergency medical personnel, family, friends, and witnesses. Familiarity with the street names for PCP can be helpful as well. The evaluation should include serum PCP level, fingerstick blood glucose, and complete blood count (leukocytosis, electrolyte panel). BUN and creatinine can be elevated. Creatine kinase has been shown to be elevated in $70 \\%$ of cases with PCP toxicity. Acetaminophen and salicylate levels should also be obtained. Electrocardiogram (to evaluate for conduction abnormalities), CT head (to rule out other causes of altered mental status), and cerebral spinal fluid evaluation (to rule out CNS infection) are also required as part of the workup. A urine toxicology screen can be helpful to identify coingestants, but may not be helpful to identify acute PCP intoxication because chronic PCP users can have a positive test weeks after their last use. False positives occur for PCP in patients who use methadone, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, and chlorpromazine.

    "answer": "d. Douse the area with vinegar",
    "explanation": "Irukandji syndrome is a painful condition caused by the venom of several jellyfish (phylum Cnidaria) species. It classically presents with minor pain at the site of the sting, followed by severe systemic symptoms, usually within 30 minutes, but can occur 5 minutes after the initial sting. Symptoms include severe back pain, abdominal pain, diffuse muscle cramping, diaphoresis, anxiety, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, and headache. A sense of “impending doom” has been documented to occur in the scientific literature. Although diving suits made of sting-resistant material such as lycra offer the best in-water protection against stings from Irukandji-causative species, it does not eliminate their occurrence as any area of exposed skin, such as the hands or face can potentially be stung, and it only requires one envenomation to cause the full-blown Irukandji syndrome. Stinger-resistant net enclosures offer little to no protection against these species. Although slightly controversial, the recommended first-aid management by the Australian Resuscitation Council, The Queensland Irukandji Taskforce, and the American Heart Association is to treat the area that was stung with an acetic acid solution, such as or vinegar ( $5 \\%$ acetic acid) for approximately 30 seconds to inactivate attached nematocysts. This topic is controversial as in vitro studies demonstrated that acetic acid has the ability to inactive undischarged nematocysts, but also the ability to cause further venom release in already discharged nematocysts. These studies were not performed in Irukandji-causative species, so their generalizability should be interpreted with caution. Hyperbaric oxygen would be indicated if the patient was suffering from decompression sickness, which could also cause diffuse pain, mainly in the joints. However, the fact that the patient developed these symptoms shortly after entering the water, before reaching significant depths, and not during ascent, makes this diagnosis less likely than Irukandji syndrome. Although the patient could develop an allergic reaction from the jellyfish sting, anaphylaxis is rare and has not yet been documented from Irukandji-causative species. Furthermore, the patient is not exhibiting definitive signs of anaphylaxis involving two or more organ systems (cutaneous, pulmonary, hypotension), so epinephrine is not indicated. Although the patient will likely require medications for pain control, this is of lower priority than inactivating or removing attached nematocysts. Additionally, the pain is severe enough to require opioid analgesia rather than simply an NSAID.",

    "answer": "d. Oral glucose",
    "explanation": "This child is presenting with a severe and potentially life-threatening overdose with an oral hypoglycemic. Sulfonylureas are one of a few xenobiotics that can cause severe life-threatening toxicity with exposure to just one tablet in small children/infants. Sulfonylureas are a class of anti-diabetic medications used orally for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When ingested alone or in combination with other oral hypoglycemics (e.g. metformin) or insulin, the risk for hypoglycemia increases. Sulfonylureas are especially concerning within the class of oral hypoglycemics due to the propensity to cause hypoglycemia when ingested alone which is less common with other oral hypoglycemics (e.g. metformin) which often become an issue only when combined with other glucose-lowering agents. Further, sulfonylureas are concerning due it's long half-life and duration of toxicity, delayed nature of toxicity, and paradoxical hypoglycemia after administration of sugar products (see below). With a suspected or confirmed sulfonylurea overdose, recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia is critical. Altered mentation, confusion, seizures, diaphoresis, agitation, anxiety, restlessness, lightheadedness, and hallucinations characterize symptoms of hypoglycemia for which one or all may be present. Treatment should first be aimed at raising serum glucose concentrations immediately with either oral glucose or intravenous dextrose if IV has been established. Glucagon can be administered intramuscularly if IV access has not been established or is delayed. Oral glucose is the preferred route to raise serum glucose levels, especially in sulfonylurea overdoses. This is due to the paradoxical nature of persistent hypoglycemia with dextrose administration in the sulfonylurea-toxic patient. Larger boluses of dextrose can cause further hypoglycemia by stimulating more sulfonylurea-induced insulin release in response to larger serum glucose levels. Oral administration of sugar can also cause this paradoxical effect but less frequently as compared to intravenous dextrose. Octreotide is used in cases of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia based on its mechanism of action on islet pancreatic beta cells. Octreotide binds to the sulfonylurea receptor on the ATP-dependent potassium efflux channels. The result of octreotide binding to its receptor results in the closing and therefore termination of potassium ions effluxed to the extracellular space. This results in downstream deactivation of the secondary messenger cAMP and subsequently retarding the release of insulin granules into the bloodstream. Somatostatin can be used in cases of Sulfonylurea induced hypoglycemia; however, octreotide is more specific for its receptor. Glucagon can be used in the initial management of severe hypoglycemia where IV access has not been established for any reason. IV access should eventually be used so that IV dextrose can be used in cases where oral glucose is contraindicated (e.g. unable to protect the airway, aspiration risk). Finally, octreotide IV should be administered in cases of either delayed, rebound, or persistent hypoglycemia.",

Hydrocarbons can cause ventricular dysrhythmias as a result of exposure, either by inhalation or ingestion. The dysrhythmia results from increased sensitivity of the myocardium due to the hydrocarbon exposure and a subsequent sympathetic surge. Beta-adrenergic antagonists will mitigate the effect of the sympathetic system on the myocardium and will increase the chances of successful cardioversion.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Inhibits activation of GABA-A ligand-gated chloride ion channel",
    "explanation": "This scenario describes a case of benzodiazepine toxicity. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that serves as an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord. GABA binds to two major postsynaptic receptors, the GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. The GABA-A receptor is an ionotropic ligand-gated chloride ion channel that increases chloride ion conductance in the presence of GABA, thereby hyperpolarizing the postsynaptic cell and inhibiting the transmission of an action potential. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that act upon benzodiazepine receptors (BZ-R) in the central nervous system (CNS). The receptor is a protein comprised of five transmembrane subunits that form a chloride channel in the center, i.e., the GABA-A receptor. Activation of the BZ-R causes a conformational change to a central pore, which allows the entrance of chloride ions into the neuron. The influx of the chloride anion hyperpolarizes the neuron, resulting in the decreased firing of action potentials of that neuron. Flumazenil is a GABA-A receptor antagonist, acting to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. Flumazenil functions through competitive inhibition of the alpha-gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Administration of flumazenil should be carried out judiciously, as it may precipitate withdrawal seizures. It is useful in reversing coma due to benzodiazepine overdose.",

This technique is suggested to prevent further injury following envenomation. The wrapping should be tight but not to the point that circulation is affected. There should be a frequent examinations to ensure that the most distal parts (i.e., fingers, toes) remain pink. Recommendations are that the bandages be removed for 90 seconds and reapplied every 10 minutes, but this should in no way impact the speed of transport to a hospital.

    "explanation": "This patient presents with a sympathomimetic toxidrome secondary to acute cocaine toxicity. The commonly used urine screening assays for cocaine work through the detection of the primary metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, rather than the parent compound. This metabolite is detectable in the urine within 4 hours of use and can remain detectable for up to 1 week in heavy or prolonged use. Thus, positive detection does not necessarily indicate acute intoxication. These assays are characterized by a high sensitivity and specificity for benzoylecgonine. Accumulation of this compound may also be detected in a patient's hair sample. Acute cocaine intoxication results in a sympathomimetic toxidrome which may be distinguished from anticholinergic toxicity by the presence of diaphoresis and increased bowel sounds versus anhidrosis and depressed bowel sounds. Cocaine toxicity may result in seizures and wide-complex tachycardias, the latter of which is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment also centers on benzodiazepines and strict avoidance of betablockers which may lead to an unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation.

This measure can also help limit the development of microbial resistance to QACcontaining solutions. All other options can provide some protection against acute exposure to cleaning solutions. However, they may not be effective in preventing dermatitis if the skin is exposed to the compounds for extended periods.",

PCP is a crystalline powder that can be ingested orally, injected intravenously, inhaled, or smoked. PCP is available as a powder, crystal, liquid, and tablet. It produces both stimulation and depression of the CNS. PCP is a non-competitive antagonist to the NMDA receptor, which causes analgesia, anesthesia, cognitive defects, and psychosis. PCP blocks dopamine and norepinephrine uptake, leading to sympathomimetic effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, bronchodilation, and agitation. Sedation with medication and physical restraints may be required to control agitation, violent behavior, and psychosis due to PCP intoxication. Placing the patient in a calm environment such as a quiet room with the lights dimmed may help. Benzodiazepines are the preferred medication for chemical sedation in patients with PCP toxicity. Lorazepam 2 to $4 \\ : \\mathrm { m g }$ intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) or diazepam 5 to 10 mg IV or IM are recommended. Repeated doses every 10 minutes may be required for adequate sedation. Benzodiazepines are also the first-line treatment for PCP-induced hypertension and seizures. Hyperthermia from PCP toxicity is due to psychomotor agitation and can be successfully treated with benzodiazepines as well. Most patients survive PCP intoxication with supportive care. Airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to patients' care with PCP toxicity. Intubation with ventilatory support may be required for airway protection.",

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Respiratory alkalosis",
    "explanation": "Salicylate toxicity is a medical emergency. A salicylate level should be checked on all patients with a concern for salicylate toxicity. Serial levels are recommended as absorption is widely variable and will impact the treatment. Acetaminophen levels should also be checked as confusion about what substance was ingested may occur. Electrolytes, including calcium and magnesium, ABG, LFTs, CBC, lactate, and coagulation studies, should be obtained. Salicylate is a hydrocarbon and is neurotoxic in overdose or chronic use. Direct stimulation of the cerebral medulla (respiratory center) causes hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis is the most likely acid-base derangement based on the patient's lack of symptoms and therefore less likely mixed metabolic picture at this time. Regardless, a mixed metabolic picture is not one of the answer choices making respiratory alkalosis the most likely. Respiratory acidosis can occur with end-stage toxicity where respirations are severely depressed and ventilation is failing. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis would not be expected, salicylates cause increased lactate production accounting for the majority of free acid. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis can occur, often as a mixed picture with either an early respiratory alkalosis (Secondary to stimulation of the medulla respiratory center) or anion-gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Only respiratory alkalosis is the most likely non-mixed/compensated metabolic derangement based on the history (asymptomatic), and exam (relatively benign at this time, 2 hrs after ingestion). The metabolic picture after salicylate overdose can be complicated and often mixed metabolic presentations are not uncommon. After toxic ingestion, salicylate will stimulate the medulla respiratory center (hydrocarbon toxin) resulting in increased tachypnea and eventual early respiratory alkalosis. As toxicity pursues and often with symptoms at this time, an anion gap metabolic acidosis begins to form. Specifically, as aspirin is metabolized, it causes an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Lactate levels then increase due to the increase in anaerobic metabolism. The lactic acid, along with a slight contribution from the salicylate metabolites results in metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap (\"MUDPILES\"). As lactate levels begin to rise resulting in metabolic acidosis, a compensatory respiratory alkalosis begins (in addition to the existing early respiratory alkalosis initially present secondary to medulla stimulation in the CNS). Finally, a mixed metabolic picture involves severe respiratory acidosis (end stage of toxicity) when the patent begins to experience respiratory failure. In sum, the following can occur after an acute overdose of salicylates: (1) Early metabolic alkalosis, $\\ -- > ( 2 )$ Anion Gap (lactate) metabolic acidosis (also w/ some contribution of salicylate and metabolites directly), $\\ -- > ( 3 )$ Compensatory respiratory alkalosis (in response to metabolic acidosis), $\\ -- > ( 4 )$ Respiratory acidosis (end-stage toxicity).

    "explanation": "Salicylate toxicity is a medical emergency that needs immediate attention and treatment. Indications for hemodialysis include altered mental status, severe acidosis $\\mathrm { ( p H } 7 . 2 \\mathrm { ) }$ , hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, salicylate level greater than $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / d L }$ , mechanical ventilation, or end-organ damage. The patient in the question stem is slightly altered but also influenced by alcohol and benzodiazepines, likely contributing to her confusion. Common signs of end-organ damage in salicylate toxicity include seizures, rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, and renal failure. Hemodialysis removes salicylates and lactate, which should improve the patient's metabolic acidosis. In an acute salicylate overdose, the onset of symptoms will occur within 3 to 8 hours. The severity of symptoms is dependent on the amount ingested. For mild ingestions (salicylate levels 40 to $\\mathrm { 8 0 ~ m g / d l } )$ ), nausea, vomiting, and generalized abdominal pain are common. Tachypnea is usually present. Headaches and dizziness may also occur. The classic finding of tinnitus may also be present. Patients with moderate salicylate toxicity (80 to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / d l } )$ will experience more severe neurological symptoms. These can include confusion, slurred speech, and hallucinations. Tachypnea is more pronounced and is accompanied by tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension. Expect these symptoms 6 to 18 hours after ingestion. Salicylate levels more than $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / d L }$ are considered severe toxicity and occur 12 to 24 hours after ingestion. Damage to the basement membranes will cause cerebral and pulmonary edema. Patients may become obtunded and develop seizures. Hypoventilation may replace hyperventilation, which is concerning for impending respiratory failure. While not ideal for metabolic disorders, endotracheal intubation may be necessary for airway protection. Hypotension due to acidosis and hypovolemia is possible.

    "answer": "a. Granite stone",
    "explanation": "Silica is the most plentiful mineral on Earth. It is distributed throughout the Earth's crust and is the main constituent of greater than $9 5 \\%$ of rocks. In its respirable form, silica, once inhaled, is small enough to reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli of the respiratory system. Once inhaled, a pathologic cycle of inflammation and parenchymal damage takes place, ultimately leading to the development of progressive lung scarring and restrictive lung disease, characteristic of silicosis. Industries that place workers at risk of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) exposure include abrasive blasting, the manufacture of denim jeans, artificial stone countertop production and manipulation, pottery, porcelain work, tunneling, mining, and constructing underground subways. The newer industries of sand-blasting denim and working with engineered stone have been associated with alarmingly high rates of silicosis. In the United States, individuals who work with artificial stone countertops are frequently exposed to hazardous concentrations of silica dust, which are released into the air with cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing stone slabs. The use of wet-cutting saws, dust extraction systems, and personal respiratory equipment are other avenues to primary prevention. To confidently diagnose silicosis, alternative diagnoses must be excluded. Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and lung cancer are common mimickers of silicosis. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a lung biopsy may be considered. When viewed under a microscope, biopsies consistent with silicosis would reveal acellular whorls of hyaline collagen. Birefringent crystals will be present if viewed under polarized light, confirming the presence of silica.",

Additionally, x-ray imaging is available quickly and generally does not require leaving the emergency department, which should be avoided in this unstable patient. Serum aspirin levels, serum alcohol levels, and CT of the head may be required in a patient with altered mental status but are unlikely to elucidate the cause of this child's foamy emesis, hypotension, and abdominal distention.

    "answer": "d. Nystagmus",
    "explanation": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a dissociative anesthetic commonly used recreational drug. PCP is a crystalline powder that can be ingested orally, injected intravenously, inhaled, or smoked. Common street names for PCP are the peace pill, angel dust, crystal joints, rocket fuel, sawgrass, zoom, the sheets, and elephant tranquilizer. PCP is available as a powder, crystal, liquid, and tablet. It produces both stimulation and depression of the CNS. PCP is a non-competitive antagonist to the NMDA receptor, which causes analgesia, anesthesia, cognitive defects, and psychosis. PCP blocks dopamine and norepinephrine uptake, leading to sympathomimetic effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, bronchodilation, and agitation. PCP can also cause sedation, muscarinic, and nicotinic signs by binding to acetylcholine receptors and GABA receptors. Sigma receptor stimulation by PCP causes lethargy and coma. Depending on the dose, administration route, and coingestants, PCP can cause a wide spectrum of clinical effects, from a coma to extreme agitation or psychosis. Often, patients cannot give a clear history, so it is imperative to attempt to obtain a history from emergency medical personnel, family, friends, and witnesses. Familiarity with the street names for PCP can be helpful as well. The general examination ranges from coma to severe agitation, hyperthermia, and hypoxia. HEENT shows nystagmus (horizontal, vertical, or rotary) in up to $90 \\%$ of patients. Miosis is also common. Cardiovascular shows hypertension $( 6 0 \\% )$ and tachycardia $( 3 0 \\% )$ . Most patients survive PCP intoxication with supportive care. Airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to patients' care with PCP toxicity. Intubation with ventilatory support may be required for airway protection. Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally unnecessary in PCP ingestions; however, activated charcoal may be beneficial with massive ingestion of PCP or a dangerous coingestion. Activated charcoal therapy should only be started within one hour from the time of ingestion.

During intense physical activity, the absence of oxygen directs the conversion of pyruvate to lactate while oxidizing NADH produced during glycolysis. The woman in the vignette is not able to deliver sufficient oxygen to her working muscles, further evidenced by the oxygen debt incurred that requires her to rest several minutes in order to catch her breath. Lactic acid accumulation in muscle results in muscle weakness, cramping, and pain.",

    "answer": "c. Seafood that was likely wild-caught",
    "explanation": "This patient presented with generalized muscle weakness, respiratory failure, fixed and dilated pupils, and aphonia after consuming exotic seafood, likely fugu, more commonly known as the pufferfish. It is known to be poisonous for its tetrodotoxin content. The toxin inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing cell membranes from depolarizing. This, in turn, inhibits action potential propagation and prevents neurons and myocytes from functioning. Eventually, this can lead to paralysis and respiratory failure. The animals themselves do not produce the toxin but rather accumulate the toxin through their diet by eating other animals inoculated with tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. As such, pufferfish raised in captivity and on special farms can contain almost undetectable levels of tetrodotoxin, making them safe to eat, a practice that is becoming more common. As such, wild-caught pufferfish are more likely to contain dangerous levels of toxins than those that have been bred specifically for consumption. Although the initial symptoms of tetrodotoxin toxicity can mimic foodborne gastroenteritis, thoroughly cooking the meat of the fish will not prevent toxicity as the toxin is heat-stable. Although special training, licensing, and certifications for chefs exist to help decrease the likelihood of toxic pufferfish being served to consumers, improved sanitation and hygiene are unlikely to prevent consumer toxicity, as the toxin does not come from food contamination.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Opthalmology consultation for removal of the hairs",
    "explanation": "Eye pain immediately following a tarantula exposure is likely due to ocular exposure to the tarantula's urticating hairs. Patients will often present with a painful, red, conjunctival injection due to corneal or scleral irritation, a reaction termed ophthalmia nodosa. Long-term vision loss can occur after corneal injury associated with panuveitis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Ocular involvement, whether suspected or confirmed by slit lamp, should prompt ophthalmology consultation as early removal of urticating hairs can reduce long-term complications, including vision loss. Although topical steroids have been shown in certain cases to reduce symptoms and aid in the resorption of hairs without complication, the decision of treating with ophthalmic steroids in place of hair removal should be made in conjunction with an ophthalmologist consultant. IV antibiotics can be useful for treating infectious etiologies of vision loss, such as endophthalmitis, but the acuity of the patient's symptoms related to a tarantula exposure makes this much less likely. Although anesthetic eye drops can provide temporary relief, they do not alter the disease course, nor prevent complications.",

      "d. Confusion and memory loss"
    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Hematuria and renal impairment",
    "explanation": "Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde that can cause damage to various organ systems upon exposure. The side effects are due to its highly reactive and damaging nature. Hematuria (blood in the urine) and renal impairment are common side effects associated with acrolein toxicity. In the respiratory system, inhalation exposure to acrolein can lead to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Acrolein's irritant properties can also affect the eyes, causing redness, burning, excessive tearing, and potential long-term damage to ocular tissues. Additionally, acrolein exposure can result in skin irritation and dermatitis. Systemically, acrolein toxicity may contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular damage, potentially impacting vital organs and systems. The kidneys are particularly vulnerable to the effects of acrolein. Acrolein exposure results in inflammation and impairment of critical cellular functions, ultimately leading to kidney injury. Acrolein can also directly damage renal tissues leading to to elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Moreover, its potential to cause inflammation and vasoconstriction in blood vessels can disrupt renal blood flow, further contributing to kidney dysfunction. Chronic exposure to acrolein has been linked to an increased risk of kidney disorders, emphasizing the need for measures to minimize exposure to this hazardous compound to protect renal health. Ingestion of acrolein may lead to gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain but patients do not typically present with gastrointestinal bleeding or liver dysfunction except when ingested at extremely high levels. Confusion and memory loss may also occur at extremely toxic doses, but hematuria and renal impairment have been shown to occur more frequently than the other answer options.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. The badge readings exceed the average exposure limit recommendations of   \n$2 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { v } /$ year over five years",
    "explanation": "The current standard, from the 2007 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, specifies a maximum permissible dose of $2 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { v } /$ year averaged over five years with no one year exceeding $5 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { v }$ . This is a decrease from the prior standard of $5 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S v } /$ year. The evolution of the radiation biology and safety knowledge base led to the formulation of the ALARA principle that states that radiation exposure should always be kept “As Low As Reasonably Achievable.” As an understanding of the health implications of radiation exposure has accumulated, standards for exposure limits of occupationally exposed workers have become more restrictive. The effective dose is a derived quantity, or mathematical construct, and not a physical, measurable quantity. The formula for calculating effective dose to a reference model incorporates terms to account for all radiation types, organ and tissue radiosensitivities, population groups, and multiple biological endpoints. Exposure surpassing this threshold averaged over five years has been associated with a projected lifetime risk of fatal cancer 1 in 1000. His family members would not be at increased risk due to his exposure. The 2011 ICRP recommendations have decreased the exposure limits to the lens of the eye from $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S v }$ in a year to $5 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { v }$ in a year, with no more than $2 0 \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { v }$ averaged over five years.

Many popular pain-relieving powder preparations contain salicylates. This patient is suffering from both acute and chronic salicylism.

Fever (without an infectious source) hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, confusion, and seizures (cerebral edema) are ominous signs of severe toxicity. If the overdose is unrecognized and untreated pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest usually result. At extremely high doses, ibuprofen and other NSAIDS can lead to salicylism, but this is rare. Usual symptoms are GI upset, tinnitus, and nystagmus.

    "answer": "c. Nodules on the dorsal aspect of both hands",
    "explanation": "Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is linked to workers in nuclear, defense, electronics, biomedical, and semiconductor industries. Patients who are genetically susceptible and are exposed to beryllium in any amount have an increased risk of developing CBD. Of the answer choices, nodules on the dorsal aspect of both hands would be most suggestive of an occupational etiology for this patient's symptoms. The most common complaints of patients presenting with CBD are dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, unintended weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Skin contact with beryllium can also cause dermatologic inflammation resulting in irritation, ulceration, and subcutaneous granulomas. Nodules on this patient's hands should raise suspicion for noncaseating granulomatous disease from beryllium exposure. CCBD is clinically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis and causes noncaseating granulomas in lung tissue and thoracic lymph nodes. It also typically lacks the extrapulmonary findings common in sarcoidosis. Cystic bone lesions, ocular involvement, neurosarcoidosis, cardiac disease, parotitis, erythema nodosum, and salivary gland involvement are all significant findings in sarcoidosis but not CBD. While a fever may be present during the acute immune response to beryllium exposure, it is unlikely to be found in a patient experiencing symptoms for six weeks. People with acute beryllium sensitivity present similarly to other chemical pneumonitides with cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, hemoptysis, and palpitations.

Symptoms such as tachycardia, hypotension, or arrhythmias may be coupled with fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, and vision changes. Regular pulse oximetry devices read the percent of bound hemoglobin, irrespective of what is bound. Therefore, when CO is bound rather than O2, a patient’s pulse oximetry may still appear normal and cannot be used reliably. Instead, a co-oximeter is necessary to measure CO levels.

    "answer": "a. Simple chronic",
    "explanation": "Occupational exposure to silica dust, a main component of artificial countertops, is strongly associated with a diagnosis of silicosis. In addition, pulmonary nodules prominent in the upper posterior lung lobes are also consistent with silicosis, making it the most likely diagnosis. This patient has chronic silicosis, the most common form; the disease can present within 10-30 years of chronic silica exposure. Patients with simple chronic silicosis are often asymptomatic, but may experience respiratory symptoms, such as a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. Based on radiologic findings, chronic silicosis is further characterized as either simple or complex. Pulmonary nodules with a diameter of less than $1 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ are consistent with simple chronic silicosis. As the disease progresses, the nodules coalesce, forming conglomerate masses with diameters greater than $1 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , consistent with complicated chronic silicosis. Lymphadenopathy is often one of the earliest physical exam findings in silicosis.",

    "explanation": "While hypokalemic metabolic acidosis is a finding in toluene toxicity, it is unlikely that this adolescent patient would have profound laboratory changes after acute exposure hence the unremarkable laboratory values. Toluene is metabolized to hippuric acid by cytochrome p-450 enzymes which spontaneously deprotonates in plasma to hippurate which then ionically binds with ammonium, sodium, or potassium cations and is excreted in urine. Thus, chronic toxicity may be associated with hypokalemia resulting in weakness, spasticity, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications such as rhabdomyolysis. A physical examination should involve all systems as no set of findings exists that are specific to toluene toxicity nor dichotomize acute versus chronic exposure. There has been a progression of stages after acute exposure to toluene described by multiple studies: euphoria followed by excitability, disinhibition, and impulsive behaviors. Continued monitoring with serial labs as well as telemetry via admission to the hospital would be the most appropriate disposition for this patient.

This lipid peroxidation occurs by free radical formation from CCL4 with the help of CYP450 enzymes. This enzyme can be inhibited by intravenous cimetidine. Cimetidine acts as a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. When this enzyme is inhibited by cimetidine, free radical formation is decreased from CCL4. So, complications will be less. Intravenous glucose also acts like as intravenous cimetidine to downregulate CYP450 to reduce CCL4 degradation. If an appropriate measure is not taken in a patient with CCL4 intoxication, life-threatening complications may develop.

    "explanation": "Ciguatera is a foodborne illness caused by eating fish contaminated with toxins produced by dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus. Ciguatoxin is tasteless, odorless, lipid soluble, and heat-resistant, so ciguatoxin-laden fish cannot be detoxified by normal cooking. Predator fish have higher concentration of the toxins after eating herbivorous fish. Barracudas, groupers, moray eels, snapper, and amberjacks are commonly implicated but it is also found in over 400 species of reef fish. Signs and symptoms of ciguatera toxin in humans include gastrointestinal and neurological effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, muscle aches, paresthesia, numbness, vertigo, ataxia, and hallucinations. The treatment of ciguatera poisoning is supportive care. There is no specific antidote for the toxin. If the patient’s nausea and vomiting are not severe, activated charcoal may be used in the first few hours of toxicity to prevent further absorption of the ciguatoxin. Antihistamines can be used for pruritus. Symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting should also be provided. Dehydration can occur due to nausea and vomiting and should be treated with intravenous fluids. There is evidence that calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and verapamil are useful in treating some symptoms like headache. In rare cases, patients may experience respiratory failure and should be managed by traditional rapid sequence intubation. Symptomatic bradycardia is treated with intravenous atropine.

    "answer": "b. Amanita phalloides intoxication",
    "explanation": "Amanita phalloides, also known as death cap, is a deadly poisonous mushroom. It is frequently mistaken for edible mushrooms and causes acute hepatic failure due to the amatoxins. The amanitin toxin is heat stable, remaining toxic whether eaten raw or cooked. The mechanism of action of amatoxin is by inhibiting RNA polymerase, causing disruption of transcription of mRNA. As a result, hepatocytes cannot synthesize key protein coding genes, leading to the disintegration of nucleoli and pathologically centrilobular hepatic necrosis. The course of Amanita toxicity has three phases: The first stage does not begin until six to 12 hours after ingestion; often, foragers comment on how good the food made from Amanita species tastes, and there are no signs of a problem for at least 6 hours. After this silent phase, it is followed by the onset of nausea, abdominal cramps, profuse watery diarrhea, and signs of dehydration. A physical exam may reveal dry mucosal membranes and tachycardia, and given sufficient dehydration, hypotension. After the GI phase, the second stage appears where the patient appears to recover transiently, and GI symptoms resolve, but ongoing liver damage continues. This stage may last two to three days and is characterized by rising liver function transaminase, bilirubin, the development of coagulopathy, and eventually hepatic encephalopathy. In the third stage, both liver and renal function become compromised. Hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy may occur rapidly after laboratory signs of liver injury, and death can occur in three to seven days.

Sixth nerve palsies, ptosis, and vertical-gaze palsies all typically recover completely, while the fine horizontal nystagmus can persist indefinitely. If the ocular abnormality does not improve after administrating thiamine, the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome should be reevaluated. Approximately half of the patients with this syndrome have complete recovery of their ataxic symptoms. The other half have an incomplete recovery, manifesting as a slow, shuffling, wide-based gait.",

    "explanation": "This patient presents with tick paralysis. The rocky mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) is found in the western United States (California, Washington, Colorado). Typically, the tick must remain on the person for 5 to 6 days to cause systemic effects. The tick's salivary glands produce a toxin that causes decreased sodium channel conductance, leading to presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction (similar to botulinum toxin). This results in ascending flaccid paralysis beginning in the bilateral legs and may be associated with sensory deficits and diarrhea. Progression occurs over 1 to 2 days and may include hypoventilation, lethargy, coma, and death if the tick is not removed. The American Dog tick (D. variabilis) is found in the southeastern United States (Georgia, North Carolina). The Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum) is found in the eastern, midwest, and southeast United States. In Australia, Ixodes holocyclus is the most common cause of tick paralysis and is the most potent paralyzing tick in the world. Demyelination is seen in Guillain-Barre syndrome.

    "answer": "a. Nucleus accumbens",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with anxiety, euphoria, mydriasis, tachycardia, and diaphoresis in the context of a urine drug screen positive for cocaine. The area of the brain that would be most active in response to the rewarding feeling from cocaine use is the nucleus accumbens. The mesolimbic pathway of dopamine neurons starts at the ventral tegmental area and projects to the nucleus accumbens. The nucleus accumbens is involved in the sense of reward from cocaine use. Additionally, the nucleus accumbens is involved in a rewarding feeling associated with amphetamine use. Patients with acute cocaine toxicity presenting to the emergency department (ED) may require urgent treatment for tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm, leading to pathological sequelae such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and death. The adverse effects on the heart are due to the direct actions of cocaine by inhibiting the reuptake of catecholamines into the nerve endings. The increased catecholamine levels can induce life-threatening arrhythmias, and at the same time, the local anesthetic properties of cocaine further impair impulse conduction, leading to re-entry ventricular arrhythmias. Long-term use of cocaine can also alter cardiac histology leading to fibrosis, myocarditis, and contraction band necrosis. Cocaine significantly increases myocardial oxygen requirements, heart rate, and cardiac output. In patients with even mild coronary disease, these hemodynamic changes and vasoconstriction can trigger acute coronary syndrome. Aside from the myocardium, cocaine can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Cocaine can also cause seizures by lowering the threshold for seizure initiation. Chronic use of cocaine can lower the density of dopamine receptors leading to extrapyramidal symptoms, dystonia, bradykinesia, akinesia, and akathisia.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Generation of reactive oxygen species",
    "explanation": "Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde that is produced through the combustion of substances like cigarette smoke. The primary mechanism of acrolein toxicity involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, cellular damage, and an inflammatory response. Acroleins highly reactive nature allows it to disrupt crucial cellular processes by readily forming covalent bonds with cellular substances such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. This chemical reactivity leads to widespread cellular damage. It is particularly damaging to proteins, where it can lead to protein dysfunction and aggregation, disrupting cellular processes. In this patient, exposure to acrolein has caused irritation of the respiratory mucosa, leading to severe respiratory distress, cough, and chest pain. The multi-faceted mechanism of toxicity contributes to acrolein's harmful effects on various organs and systems in the body, including the cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Chronic exposure to acrolein can also have detrimental effects on the eyes as seen in our patient. When it comes in contact with the eyes, acrolein can cause severe irritation, redness, and burning sensations. It is known to be a potent irritant to the mucous membranes of the eye, leading to symptoms such as excessive tearing, blurred vision, and even corneal damage in extreme cases. Prolonged or high-level exposure to acrolein can result in more serious eye injuries, including inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and potential long-term damage to the delicate eye tissues. Therefore, proper precautions and safety measures are essential when working with or around acrolein to protect the eyes and overall ocular health. Though the other answer options are related to other substances that can affect multiple organ systems, the mechanisms listed are not associated with acrolein toxicity. Inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes is seen in organophosphate and carbamate poisoning. Binding to opioid receptors is relevant to opioid toxicity. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes is associated with certain antidepressants and tyramine-containing foods.",

This energy depletion affects the cellular processes within the liver leading to their dysfunction and subsequent toxicity. Chloroform does not inhibit cytochrome p450. Hepatic chloroform metabolism is mediated by cytochrome P450 resulting in the formation of phosgene. Direct inhibition of glutathione synthesis is not the primary mechanism of chloroform toxicity. While chloroform can deplete glutathione levels indirectly through the formation of reactive metabolites, it is not the main pathway responsible for the observed organ toxicity.

    "explanation": "The presence of blood and calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, along with costovertebral angle tenderness, suggests nephrolithiasis. Given the patient's propensity for drinking whatever she can find, this suggests ethylene glycol toxicity. The diagnosis can be confirmed with the serum finding of a large anion-gap metabolic acidosis and any detectable ethylene glycol in the serum. Ethanol or fomepizole are competitive inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their respective toxic metabolites. Isopropyl alcohol does not have toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is the specific antidote used to treat ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning.

This enzymatic reaction is catabolized by cytochrome P450, especially by its isoenzyme CYP2E1 and microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). Alcohol can induce both of these enzymes. CYP2E1 and microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system activity is induced by prolonged alcohol use, whereas even a single dose of alcohol may induce microsomal ethanoloxidizing system activity. If CCL4 toxicity occurs in a patient with alcohol use disorder, it will increase the adverse effects of CCL4 that may be the cause of delayed recovery and several complications such as three out of 10 in this case.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "d",
    "answer": "d. Prostaglandin induced vasodilation",
    "explanation": "Niacin, in its nicotinic acid form (immediate-release), typically floods the high-volume, glycine-conjugation liver pathway, resulting in the production of the nicotinuric acid metabolite, leading to the triggering of prostaglandin-mediated flushing. The emergency department assessment begins with rapid assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, in addition to finger-stick glucose, oxygen saturation, and core temperature. Rewarming for hypothermia, dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia, in addition to intravenous crystalloid volume replacement may be required. In rare cases, a bicarbonate drip may be indicated or vasopressor support. Some severe cases have required a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or packed red blood cells. In patients who develop severe hepatotoxicity, consultation with gastroenterology is needed for consideration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy and possible liver transplant. While the flushing can be alarming to the patient, it is self-limiting and does not require medication, although it would be responsive to the antiprostaglandin properties of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ketorolac. Flushing is part of anaphylaxis and is triggered by an IgE-mediated effect on mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Inflammatory mediators are released in this process, leading to skin flushing and other manifestations. Epinephrine counteracts this cascade. This patient has no other signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis. Flushing can be part of a presentation of serotonin syndrome due to excessive stimulation of 5- HT2A/5HT1A receptors. It can be life-threatening and is usually accompanied by tremors, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, and delirium, none of which this patient has. A nonselective serotonin antagonist may help treat this, along with benzodiazepines. Several medications and toxins can cause anticholinergic toxicity, which can present with flushing as one of its symptoms.",

    "explanation": "This patient has presented with a non-specific headache and dizziness. His examination is unremarkable, apart from a flushed appearance. His history of a recent change in his apartment and an elevated carboxyhemoglobin concentration suggest the likelihood of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. Removal from the site of poisoning and administration of oxygen is essential in CO poisoning. Selected patients may benefit from hyperbaric therapy (HBOT). Hyperbaric therapy leads to a decreased half-life of carbon monoxide. It also protects against the development of delayed neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with CO poisoning. This patient's severe acidosis is an indicator of significant poisoning and of benefiting from treatment in the hyperbaric chamber. Most patients with CO poisoning present with mild symptoms and will not require hyperbaric therapy. However, individuals with severe acidosis or a carbon monoxide level greater than $2 5 \\%$ should be considered for HBOT.

    "explanation": "This patient was started on warfarin for his deep venous thrombosis. He was recently prescribed a macrolide antibiotic following which he developed gastrointestinal bleeding. This indicates the development of warfarin toxicity due to alterations in drug metabolism. Severe life-threatening bleeding should be treated with immediate discontinuation of warfarin, administration of $\\mathsf { 5 - 1 0 ~ m g }$ vitamin K intravenously, and treatment with FFP or prothrombin complex concentrate. Vitamin K leads to a sustained reversal of warfarin action but can take up to 6-10 hours, achieving complete reversal. Therefore, prompt correction of coagulopathy is required to prevent ongoing bleeding. The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is the treatment of choice for warfarin reversal. It contains all of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) in an inactivated form. Fresh frozen plasma can be used where PCC is unavailable.

    "explanation": "In $10 \\%$ to $1 5 \\%$ of patients receiving digoxin, a significant amount of the drug can get inactivated in the gastrointestinal tract by enteric bacteria, primarily Eubacterium lentum . Classic drug-drug interaction occurs with the macrolides, which sterilize the gastrointestinal tract of this bacterium and cause increased digoxin absorption. Of the macrolides, clarithromycin is the most cited offending medication and is often part of the triple cocktail for H. pylori . Malnutrition can lead to decreased protein and albumin levels, but digoxin is not highly protein-bound. Other drugs that can potentially interact with digoxin include quinidine, verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, and spironolactone. Omeprazole does not interact with digoxin to cause toxicity.

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Clonidine",
    "explanation": "This patient's symptoms suggest withdrawal from an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, a category that includes the veterinary sedative xylazine. Clonidine, another alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is a nonopioid treatment option that can reduce these withdrawal symptoms. Many illicit drugs are often adulterated with xylazine, which can contribute to withdrawal symptoms. The possible involvement of many other drugs along with xylazine underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing withdrawal symptoms, including alpha-2 adrenergic agonists such as clonidine, dexmedetomidine, tizanidine, and guanfacine for replacement therapy. Symptom management for pain may involve short-acting opioids, ketamine, gabapentin, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs. Insomnia can be managed with trazodone, quetiapine, and mirtazapine, while anxiety can be addressed with hydroxyzine and benzodiazepines. This comprehensive, multimodal approach addresses withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms from alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may overlap with those of opioid withdrawal, indicating a need for monitoring for and managing any coexisting opioid withdrawal symptoms. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine for managing anxiety and insomnia. However, in illicit drug use and withdrawal, the risk of dependence and withdrawal from benzodiazepines makes it a less desirable option. Though antihistamines like diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine can help relieve symptoms partially, they are better-used adjunctives to clonidine. Xylazine is not approved for use in humans. Fentanyl is a potent opioid that potentially exacerbates addiction. It may also mask the underlying withdrawal symptoms and lead to difficulty managing the patient's overall condition. It is not a first-line treatment for this patient's new symptoms.",

Cyanide poisoning may result from a variety of exposures, including structural fires, industrial exposures, medical exposures such as sodium nitroprusside, and certain foods. Domestic fires are the most common cause of cyanide poisoning in domestic countries. The clinical manifestations can be divided into early and late categories. Some early central nervous system findings are headache, dizziness, confusion, and mydriasis. These are due to tissue hypoxia, and seizures and coma can develop as it progresses to an altered level of consciousness. Early respiratory and cardiovascular findings include tachypnea and tachycardia, while late findings include apnea, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia. Hydroxycobalamin is the antidote of choice for acute cyanide poisoning, especially if the patient has coexisting carbon monoxide poisoning. With a carboxyhemoglobin level of $2 \\%$ , this patient likely does not have significant carbon monoxide poisoning.

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. By restoring intracellular glutathione",
    "explanation": "Acetaminophen is the most common drug-related cause of acute liver failure. Following therapeutic concentrations of oral acetaminophen, $60 \\%$ to $90 \\%$ of the drug gets metabolized in the liver to glucuronic acidand sulfate-conjugate metabolites. A smaller fraction (approximately $5 \\%$ to $1 5 \\%$ ) undergoes metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450). Metabolism primarily via CYP2E1 results in the formation of the toxic intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Typically, NAPQI is neutralized by glutathione to nontoxic metabolites. However, with excessive doses of acetaminophen, the normal phase II drug metabolism pathways become depleted. The CYP450 pathway metabolizes a higher portion of the acetaminophen taken, resulting in high concentrations of NAPQI formation. The limited glutathione stores can become depleted. Without glutathione, NAPQI concentrations build up, and NAPQI, as a reactive intermediate, can react with cellular macromolecules, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This phenomenon can lead to centrilobular (Zone 3) hepatic injury and hepatocellular death. There can also be nephrotoxicity. The only approved antidote for acetaminophen overdose and toxicity is N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is a precursor to glutathione synthesis and helps restore the intracellular stores of glutathione to neutralize the NAPQI compound. It can also inactivate NAPQI directly.",

Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade) causes anticholinergic syndrome and while the patient has general symptoms such as vomiting and tachycardia, mydriasis and diaphoresis are two additional hallmark signs of this syndrome. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and can cause a multitude of signs and symptoms due to multiple binding sites including sodium channel blockade, antihistaminergic toxicity, and others. Again, some of the signs of anticholinergic toxicity are lacking and pancytopenia would not be an expected outcome of any of the alternative choices. Although an uncommon ingestion, podophyllotoxin, and other nonalkaloid toxic agents can have serious effects, as the patient is undressed, you find the \"something\" he caught from his ex, namely genital warts. Along with multisystem organ failure, a hallmark of this type of overdose is pancytopenia. Therapy usually consists of supportive care and GI decontamination, if possible. Tricyclic antidepressants like nortriptyline often present with tachycardia and decompensation, but pancytopenia and multisystem organ failure is less likely. Its primary toxicity is cardiac as evidenced by QRS widening and eventual torsades de pointes. Toxic alcohols like methanol carry their own risk profile and side effects.

    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. G-protein coupled receptor",
    "explanation": "Toxicity or overdose with selective beta-1 blockers can result in the triad of bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The first-line medication for treating beta-blocker overdose is glucagon. Glucagon reverses the actions of beta-blockade. Its actions increase contractility, heart rate, and conduction through the atrioventricular node. It works by binding the G-protein coupled receptor (Gas-coupled proteins). This increases cAMP levels through adenylate cyclase, which in turn stimulates activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Atropine is used to counteract vagally mediated bradycardia. The mechanism of action for vagally mediated bradycardia is different than the catecholamine blockade resulting in bradycardia for the patient with selective beta-blocker overdose. Some lipophilic beta-blockers cause CNS depression, which requires immediate stabilization of airways. Beta-blocker-induced bronchospasm may be treated with oxygen and bronchodilators like albuterol. Gastric lavage may be required for patients who present immediately after large ingestions or with severe adverse symptoms. Sodium bicarbonate is indicated for QRS widening and magnesium sulfate for QTc prolongation. Glucagon reverses the actions of betablockade.

He consented to numerous subcutaneous injections of an untested dermal filler in exchange for a cosmetic procedure at a discounted price. The physician called 911 because the patient became somnolent about 3 hours into the process. In the ED, initial laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. The patient most likely suffered from severe anaphylaxis, and dialysis would not have helped remove the associated cytokines.",
    "explanation": "This patient likely suffered from glycol ether (GE) toxicity. Due to their solvent properties, GEs are used in dermal fillers. Inadvertent injection in a superficial vessel can induce severe toxicity. Severity also depends on the type of glycol ether and the amount administered. Acute toxicity produces neurological deficits such as drowsiness and weakness. Metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) produces organic acid metabolites excreted in the urine. Drugs with high solubility, such as GEs, result in a large volume of distribution and therefore are poorly removed by hemodialysis. The removal of a drug by hemodialysis is contingent on molecular weight, the volume of distribution, protein binding capacity, dialysis flow rate, and plasma clearance. Hemodialysis is still paramount in acute management to ameliorate fatal electrolyte imbalances (such as hyperkalemia) and severe acidosis. Supportive care employing intubation and mechanical ventilation is also essential should the patient lose the ability to protect the airway, as in this case. Anaphylaxis to an untested drug is a feasible differential; however, the clinical scenario and physical exam are incongruent with a typical anaphylactic reaction. There was no mention of cutaneous findings (hives, angioedema), gastrointestinal complaints, or cardiovascular compromise (hypotension). This patient’s somnolence likely resulted from neurotoxicity from glycol ether (GE) toxicity. Although neurological symptoms are part of anaphylaxis, they often manifest as altered syncope dizziness. Finally, hemodialysis is not the treatment for anaphylaxis, assuming no concurrent metabolic toxicity exists. Protein binding is an essential component regarding the kinetics of hemodialysis. Specifically, a high protein binding capacity results in lower free drug concentrations. Therefore toxins that exhibit high protein binding are poorly removed by dialysis. In this case, if the toxin in question had low protein binding capacity, it would readily be removed by dialysis, and therefore, its urinary metabolites would decrease in concentration. Flow rate is also essential in drug metabolism from an intrinsic biological perspective and artificially by hemodialysis. A low flow state to the liver and kidneys results in poor metabolism and excretion of drugs and metabolites. Similarly, a low flow state can also result in decreased removal of a toxin by hemodialysis. However, if inadequate dialysis flow were the culprit for the delayed metabolism of the toxin, the improvement in the acidosis and electrolyte imbalances would have also been delayed. Additionally, there was no explicit mention of the type of dialysis flow rate used.",

    "answer": "d. Physostigmine plus intravenous lipid emulsion",
    "explanation": "Altered mental status, tachycardia, and dry mucous membranes are anticholinergic side effects of diphenhydramine toxicity. Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can reverse the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine. Because this medication is given frequently, poison control or a toxicologist should be consulted first. The initial recommended dose is 0.5 to $2 \\ : \\mathrm { m g }$ ( $0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { m g / k g \\ I V }$ up to a maximum of $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ per dose in pediatric patients) over five minutes. Giving the medication too rapidly can result in seizure or cholinergic symptoms. Physostigmine is not currently available. Rivastigmine and pyridostigmine have been proposed as alternatives but are not approved for this indication. There is growing literature supporting the use of intravenous lipid emulsion therapy in diphenhydramine toxicity. If the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion of diphenhydramine, decontamination techniques may be considered. Single-dose activated charcoal may benefit, especially as anticholinergic effects may result in decreased gastrointestinal motility leading to delayed absorption of diphenhydramine. However, charcoal is avoided in patients with altered mental status. It can be given via NG tube if endotracheal intubation is performed first, but this is not indicated in this patient. The patient's QTc or QRS intervals are not prolonged; therefore, sodium bicarbonate is not needed. There is currently no antidote that specifically works to reverse the effects of diphenhydramine toxicity. The mainstay of therapy for diphenhydramine toxicity is supportive management that addresses the symptomatology of intoxication/overdose. If the patient were agitated or actively seizing, benzodiazepines would be the first line. This patient is neither seizing nor is she agitated.",

Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and famotidine, as well as corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone, are essential adjuncts to epinephrine, but the mainstay of anaphylaxis treatment is epinephrine. Although wheezing can occur from anaphylaxis, nebulized albuterol/ipratropium would be more appropriate for wheezing secondary to asthma. The child has no history of asthma, so an asthma exacerbation is far less likely.

    "explanation": "The toxidrome described is that of the organophosphate nerve gases. Organophosphates have the ability to irreversibly bind to acetylcholinesterase and prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine. This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. This irreversibility is timesensitive and depends on the specific agent the patient is exposed to. This process of rendering the acetylcholinesterase irreversible inactive is termed aging. Pralioxime is the antidote that prevents aging and must be given within a certain timeframe, which is dependent on the specific agent the patient is exposed to. It prevents the acetylcholinesterase from being irreversible inactivated. The initial treatment of organophosphate toxicity is with the atropine. This drug competitively inhibits acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors leads to the drying of all secretions and reduces bronchospasm. This is not time-sensitive to the specific organophosphate but should be given as soon as possible. Aging can occur from 12 to 24 hours after exposure.

Acute phosgene exposure causes chemical pneumonitis that disrupts the lower respiratory unit mechanics and causes loss of the air-blood barrier. The resulting edema into the interstitium and alveolar sacs can produce severe pulmonary edema that may progress to refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome. Factors indicating severe exposure in the above scenario include a patient in distress with observed decompensation during the examination, hypoxia, perioral sputum, and respiratory involvement. Patients with phosgene exposure who present with respiratory symptoms within 5 hours or fewer hours should be treated aggressively because respiratory symptoms onset within this period is associated with worse outcomes. In patients with phosgene exposure and respiratory involvement, the physician should have a low threshold for starting non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and intubation if hypoxia proves refractory. An intensivist should be consulted in these scenarios as these patients may require extracorporeal life support and close monitoring for decompensation. A medical history of obstructive lung disease is not known to predict a more severe clinical course; however, patients with this history may be expected to experience worsened respiratory function during the recovery period. Hypoxia is an indication of severe disease at a particular time but may not necessarily predict a severe clinical course. Tobacco use is not known to cause a more severe clinical course; however, patients who smoke tobacco occasionally report adverse taste to tobacco following phosgene exposure.",

    "explanation": "This older patient is currently on multiple medications for his various ailments. Significant drug interactions should be kept in mind when prescribing multiple medications. This is especially true for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as warfarin. Warfarin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Other drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 may lead to decreased warfarin clearance and increased pharmacological effects. Cimetidine is an H2 blocker that is inhibitory of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cimetidine co-administration leads to increased hypoprothrombinemia and warfarin levels. Other H2 blockers, such as famotidine, are not associated with a similar effect. Avoidance of drugs with potential interaction or modifying warfarin dose is necessary to prevent side effects associated with drug interactions. Amlodipine and simvastatin do not have clinically significant interaction with warfarin. St. John's wort is a herbal remedy for depression and is an enzyme inducer.

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic used in CHF, essential hypertension, and fluid retention in cirrhosis. The risk of digitalis poisoning is high with combined digoxin with spironolactone. Verapamil and Amiodarone can also increase serum levels of digoxin, leading to toxicity. Digoxin dose must be decreased by $50 \\%$ when administered with Amiodarone. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that inhibits Na-K-ATPase channels to increase intracellular calcium in the heart muscle (positive inotrope) and has a negative chronotropic effect (reduces heart rate). The liver metabolizes digoxin which is mostly excreted in the urine. Spironolactone decreases the renal clearance of digoxin by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein transporter. This P-gp is encoded by the MDR1 gene (multiple drug resistance-1). Spironolactone may give a falsely elevated Digoxin assay. Digitalis poisoning is a clinical diagnosis.

The threshold for toxicity decreases $( 1 . 3 - 1 . 5 \\mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ) in the presence of certain metabolic derangements, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia. It is not completely understood how digoxin toxicity increases the risk of arrhythmias, although it does affect cardiac tissue in several ways involving calcium, which likely explains why hypercalcemia can contribute to digoxin toxicity. One mechanism of digoxin is the direct inhibition of the ATPasedependent sodium-potassium pump. This increases intracellular sodium, which decreases the activity of the sodium-calcium exchange that normally pushes calcium out of the cell, increasing intracellular calcium. Increased intracellular calcium causes the positive inotropic action of digoxin. Changes in calcium levels can also exert electrophysiologic effects. Digoxin toxicity is also worsened by quinidine.

    "answer": "d. High-altitude pulmonary edema",
    "explanation": "This patient is experiencing acute phosgene pneumonitis, which causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to the breakdown of the endothelial line and surfactant of the lower respiratory units. Pulmonary edema may be soon after exposure or delayed, as in this scenario. Physical exertion, as in the case above, has been known to precipitate pulmonary edema. Similarly, high-altitude pulmonary edema causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that results from diffuse pulmonary vasoconstriction, which increases arterial pressure. The elevated hydrostatic pressure causes excessive fluid shifts into the pulmonary interstitium, which increases the diffusing distance of oxygen. Given the rarity of phosgene pneumonitis, it is essential to know epidemiologic trends and local industrial patterns. Welding fumes are a known source of phosgene, especially if it involves the combustion of paint products. This patient also exhibits signs of irritant toxicity, given the presence of ophthalmic and oropharyngeal irritation. Acute hypoxia can cause patients to become anxious. Wheezing is a nonspecific sign that suggests developing pulmonary edema in this case, and this patient's hypoxia should be treated aggressively. Though the above patient exhibits wheezing, this middle-aged patient is unlikely to have a new onset asthma exacerbation without a history of atopy.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "a",
    "answer": "a. Outpatient analgesia and reassurance",
    "explanation": "This patient's complaint is consistent with a sting from a sea urchin. Sea urchins have calcified spines covering their globular bodies. Sea urchin envenomation occurs when a spine penetrates soft tissue. Patients will often describe an immediate burning pain that is localized to the puncture wound. This may last several hours and is exacerbated by pressure on the wound. There may be systemic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, paresthesias, weakness, abdominal pain, syncope, hypotension, and respiratory distress. On physical exam, there may be bleeding, edema, erythema, and warmth at and surrounding the puncture site. A spine may or may not be retained in the soft tissue. In some instances, even in the absence of a spine, a dark discoloration may indicate dye in the tissues. If this is the case, the discoloration should resolve within 48 hours. Supportive care and reassurance are most appropriate when there is no evidence of a retained spine. Although secondary infection is common, antibiotics are generally not indicated unless the patient is immunocompromised, has significant comorbidities, or if there is a high clinical suspicion for infection. Imaging is not indicated unless there is a suspicion of a retained spine that is not visualized but needs to be localized. In uncomplicated cases where there is little to no suspicion of a retained foreign body, surgical exploration is not indicated.",

    "explanation": "Dronabinol is a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that obtained FDA approval in 1985 for the treatment of HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antiemetics. The estimated lethal dose of IV dronabinol is $3 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ (note this is for illustrative purposes as dronabinol is dosed orally). As such, the CNS toxicity (adverse CNS effects) of dronabinol is more applicable for monitoring dose-limiting toxicity. Signs and symptoms of toxicity include mild intoxication: drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry mouth, and tachycardia. Moderate intoxication can cause memory impairment, depersonalization, mood alteration, urinary retention, and reduced bowel motility. Severe intoxication can cause decreased motor coordination, lethargy, slurred speech, and postural hypotension. Panic attacks can occur in those with apprehension and seizures in those with existing seizure disorders. The dosing for dronabinol is generally closely monitored and titrated in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antiemetics. The recommended starting adult dosage is $5 \\mathrm { m g }$ orally 1 to 3 hours before chemotherapy, followed by 5 mg every 2 to 4 hours (for 4 to 6 doses in a day). The first dose should be on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before eating). The following doses can be taken with or without meals. Adverse effects of opioids include somnolence, decreased respiratory rate, urinary retention, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils.

    "explanation": "Around the world, theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) is primarily used as a bronchodilator for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, in the United States, asthma and COPD are mainly treated with other agents, and theophylline is largely used to treat bradycardia and apnea in premature newborns. Theophylline causes the endogenous release of catecholamines through indirect stimulation of beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, which at therapeutic levels cause desired bronchodilation. Unfortunately, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, and even levels slightly above this therapeutic window can have many adverse effects in the setting of acute and chronic toxicity. Serum levels between 5-15 mcg/mL of theophylline are considered safe Theophylline has an extremely narrow therapeutic window. Theophylline toxicity occurs when serum theophylline levels surpass the levels in the therapeutic range. This can occur by intentional overdose or unintentionally when metabolism and/or clearance of theophylline is altered due to certain physiological stressors. Theophylline has 2 primary mechanisms. One mechanism is that theophylline blocks adenosine receptors, which have both therapeutic and toxic effects such as bronchodilation, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and cerebral vasoconstriction. At larger doses, theophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase causing increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in increased levels of adrenergic activation and catecholamine release. In theophylline toxicity, epinephrine levels can be 4 to 8 times higher than normal, and norepinephrine concentrations can be 4 to 10 times higher than normal. Increased catecholamine concentrations have a variety of adverse effects such as cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Most patients with theophylline toxicity are successfully managed with supportive care. Airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to the care of patients with theophylline toxicity. Intubation with ventilator support may be required for airway protection.",

Although the diagnosis may be obvious, and the other test may need to be performed, the first step in management is to secure an airway. Hydrocarbon exposure can present in many different ways. A detailed history of the incident is needed to determine the nature of the exposure. In unresponsive patients, it is necessary to question caregivers, emergency medical services, and bystanders to get a complete picture of the exposure. If possible, try to obtain the container or bottle that was used to determine the exact chemicals to which the patient has been exposed. The initial physical exam should focus on inhalation/aspiration. The patient may be coughing and have difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. Evaluation of vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and fever. A physical exam will need to be thorough and include a respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and dermatological exam. Wheezes may be present on the respiratory exam. The patient with CNS effects may present with euphoria, agitation, hallucinations, or confusion, which may then progress to CNS depression or seizures. This initial evaluation will help to determine the best next step. Initial treatment should be based on presentation and should focus on possible respiratory or cardiac failure.

    "explanation": "Napalm is a common term that typically refers to any gel-fuel mixture. Although dozens of variations exist, the most common militarized version consists of aluminum salts, polystyrene, and benzene. The gel-fuel mixture is typically stable and much less likely to ignite prematurely than petroleum-only fuels. Many gel-fuel mixtures require very high temperatures to ignite and use burning phosphorous to ignite the fuel mixture. The consistency of napalm allows it to stay in a relatively tight stream when propelled under pressure. Modern military flamethrowers use napalm-like gel-fuel mixtures to enhance accuracy and minimize flame exposure to nearby structures and personnel. The gel-fuel mixture creates a substance that burns longer than the fuel itself, resulting in more damage to personnel and structures.",

Venous blood pH, electrolytes, serum osmolarity, and urine studies were obtained before, immediately after, thirty minutes, and one hour after exposure. A comprehensive urine drug screen was also done after the test and was always unremarkable. Subjects reported confusion afterward but denied hearing or vision changes. The following qualitative chart was constructed from the quantitative data.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. The culprit chemical may have been a glycol ether and displayed firstorder kinetics.",
    "explanation": "Glycol ethers (GE) are commonly used in household cleaning products. Patients can be exposed to GEs via skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Occupational exposure in patients who work in industrial factories is generally via inhalation. Direct inhalation can rapidly increase blood concentration. GEs are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to their respective organic acids. Once absorbed, the shear presence of the GE will increase the serum osmolarity. As it is metabolized by first-order kinetics, it produces an organic acid, raising blood pH. The organic acid is then eliminated in the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Checking the pH, electrolytes, osmolarity, anion gap and urine pH is part of the evaluation for GE toxicity. GEs follow first-order kinetics, meaning metabolism is proportional to the concentration. In this scenario, as the doses of the cleaning product were increased, the numerical values of the test results proportionally increased, and the overall trend was maintained. This is in contrast to nitric oxide, which follows zero-order kinetics, where the elimination rate is constant or linear, regardless of the concentration. The answer \"the culprit chemical may have been a salicylate derivative and displayed zero-order kinetics\" is incorrect because salicylates follow first-order kinetics, similar to GEs. Also, salicylate toxicity initially results in respiratory alkalosis (low blood pH) and metabolic acidosis (high blood pH); ultimately, a mixed disorder occurs. This trend is not consistent with the chart provided. Moreover, the patients reported confusion after exposure (commonly seen with GE toxicity) instead of tinnitus or ringing in the ears (seen with salicylate toxicity). Ethanol is not the correct answer because it follows zero-order elimination kinetics; therefore, there would be no proportional increase in elimination, as seen in this case. Ethanol would also be identified in a comprehensive urine drug screen which was negative after the test. It is essential to recognize that GEs are not recognized on standard urine drug screens. Specific serum assays often need to be collected. Thus, the history, physical exam, and other routine tests are essential for assessing GE toxicity.",

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Atropine and pralidoxime",
    "explanation": "The history and symptoms are typical of organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphate compounds inhibit the acetylcholine esterase enzyme leading to its accumulation at muscarinic and nicotinic sites in the body. Muscarinic side effects are lacrimation, salivation, vomiting, and bowel bladder hyperactivity. Nicotinic side effects are muscle twitching, fasciculations, and weakness. After stabilizing the patient, atropine and pralidoxime are the antidotes of choice. Atropine helps relieve the muscarinic effects of poisoning like salivation, lacrimation, and vomiting. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase reactivator that acts by binding with the organophosphate compound and allowing acetylcholinesterase to function, thus allowing the accumulated acetylcholine at various sites in the body to get hydrolyzed. Further management may include the estimation of blood levels of acetylcholinesterase. However, the results will rarely be available in time to dictate any changes in clinical decision-making. N-acetylcysteine is an antidote used for acetaminophen poisoning. Chelation with deferoxamine is commonly done in the cases of iron toxicity. Hemodialysis is done in cases of toxicities such as alcohol, salicylates, and lithium. It is not necessary with the presenting signs and symptoms.",

    "explanation": "Manganese is an essential transition metal (atomic number 25) abundantly found in the natural Earth's crust. Manganese is primarily found in the environment complexed with carbon, oxygen, and chloride. The divalent form $\\left( \\mathrm { M n } 2 + \\right)$ is the most common and most bioavailable. The trivalent form $\\left( \\mathrm { M n } 3 + \\right)$ is also biologically important and can be found in several important catalytic enzyme systems such as superoxide dismutase, xanthine oxidase, glutamine synthase, and superoxide dismutase. Manganese has many uses in industry and has been used for centuries. Manganese salts which are brightly pigmented have been found in prehistorical paintings and glass making. Other benefits include weaponry with a manganese-iron alloy which is the most common industrial use today. Manganese oxides are used in battery manufacturing and manganese salts (notably magnesium chloride) are used in the manufacturing of dry-cell batteries. Manganese sulfate can also be used as a fungicide. The most common exposure to manganese is from environmental sources such as leakage into well water and mining workers. The most common route of exposure causing toxicity is the inhalation of dust and fumes in industry. Enteral toxicity can occur but is less common due to limited absorption from the gut. Manganese, like many metals, accumulates in the CNS and is a neurotoxin. Signs and symptoms tend to present in an insidious manner with chronic exposures dominating the clinical picture. Manganese has a propensity to accumulate in the basal ganglia (an area comprised of pathways dominated by dopaminergic-rich neural pathways). As such, exposures can result in a Parkinsonian-like syndrome, which is characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as facial masking, low-volume speech, dysphagia, micrographia, cog-wheel rigidity, and shuffling gait. Psychiatric symptoms include apathy, emotional lability, and with later manifestations, cognitive impairment, and even visual hallucinations. Several other neurotoxins have a propensity to accumulate within the basal ganglia but not all cause extrapyramidal signs and symptoms which helps narrow the differential diagnosis. Other basal ganglia toxins that can overlap in presentation with manganese toxicity include MPTP (1-metyl-4-fenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin), carbon disulfide, ß-Nmethylamino-L-alanine (BMAA; produced by Cycadophyta plants). Toxins that affect the cerebellum would be expected to cause issues with balance and coordination. The hippocampus can be affected by various toxins such as ethanol but this is an unlikely exposure in this scenario and would not be expected to cause EPS symptoms. Toxins that accumulate in the prefrontal cortex tend to cause behavioral disturbances and cognitive disturbances affecting decision-making and other cognitive tasks.",

These pathways include CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Alprazolam is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system. The addition of fluvoxamine to the patient's medication regimen will inhibit the metabolism of alprazolam and cause the level of alprazolam in the blood to rise. Depending on the patient, this rise in alprazolam blood levels could lead to toxic symptoms such as confusion in this case. A patient on both alprazolam and fluvoxamine might present with anxiety symptoms if the fluvoxamine was removed as the metabolism is increased by the removal of enzymatic inhibition, causing the blood levels of alprazolam to drop.",

    "answer_idx": "b",
    "answer": "b. Hypokalemia",
    "explanation": "Hypokalemia is a common side effect of digoxin immune fab (DIF). It can present with signs and symptoms of polyuria, muscle weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes, fatigue, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, it is essential to monitor post-administration serum potassium levels to avoid hypokalemia. Digoxin binds to myocyte sodium-potassium ATPase and renders it inactive. Consequently, the transport of potassium from the extracellular space to the intracellular space is restricted and results in clinically dangerous hyperkalemia. This explains the patients' pre-administration high serum potassium levels at the time of presentation. DIF binds to free serum digoxin molecules and creates an extracellular concentration gradient, which favors the disassociation of digoxin from the myocyte sodium-potassium ATPases. Reversal of digoxin results in the transport of extracellularly accumulated potassium back into cells resulting in clinically relevant hypokalemia. Symptoms of confusion, yellow blurry vision, and abdominal pain are commonly associated with digoxin overdose. In this patient, the increase in the recent onset of palpitation episodes can be a sign of inadequate digoxin dosage. His self-increased administration has resulted in digoxin overdose.",

Telogen effluvium is a disorder characterized by the thinning or loss of hair resulting from the premature entry of hair in the telogen phase (the resting phase of the hair follicle). Patients on chronic valproate therapy may present with greying of hair. Valproate-induced hair loss is diffused, nonscarring, and dose-related. Other hair-related adverse events are curling hair and greying of hair. Finasteride can increase or maintain the number of terminal hairs in the anagen phase by inhibiting the miniaturization of the hair follicle and is indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia. Alopecia areata usually presents with round patches of nonscarring alopecia with exclamation point hairs.

It has been implicated in epidemics in western Nigeria during the 1950s, caused by consuming the African silkworm (Anapha venata) for protein. The larvae of the Anapha venata contain heat-resistant thiaminases and have been associated with thiamine deficiency in people, causing the clinical syndrome of seasonal ataxia. Coinciding with the rainy season of July through October in Nigeria, the larvae are abundantly found in local markets and frequently consumed with high carbohydrate-based foods containing thiamine-binding cyanogenetic glycosides. Frequent exposures to the Preolis semirufa caterpillars of Brazil are associated with a significant joint disease called pararamose.

    ],
    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Dimercaprol plus calcium disodium edetate",
    "explanation": "Monotherapy with dimercaprol is used in toxic exposure to arsenic, mercury, and gold. Combined therapy with intramuscular dimercaprol and IV calcium disodium edetate is currently the only FDA-approved treatment in cases of acute lead encephalopathy for both adults and children. Calcium disodium edetate can cross the blood-brain barrier, and although this is beneficial, lead redistribution into the cerebral spinal fluid is an initial risk. Dimercaprol is often administered before calcium disodium edetate to limit the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. DMSA is FDA approved for the treatment of toxic exposure to lead in children when whole blood concentrations are above 45 mcg/dL. Although DMSA cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, case reports show its efficacy in lowering whole-blood lead concentrations. However, most of these case reports are patients with no symptoms of lead encephalopathy and whole blood lead concentrations that are only mildto-moderately elevated.",

Her past medical history is significant for a two-year-old diagnosis of chronic atrial fibrillation. On further questioning, her husband states that she has never consumed papaya since childhood. Clinical evaluation reveals elevated serum potassium levels and moderately elevated serum digoxin levels. The patient is then administered digoxin immune fab (DIF) due to suspected digoxin overdose. After an initial improvement in clinical symptoms, the patient develops wheezing, generalized itching, and rapid swelling of the lips. What side effect of DIF is the patient experiencing?",

    "answer_idx": "c",
    "answer": "c. Papain hypersensitivity",
    "explanation": "Digoxin immune fab (DIF) should not be administered in patients with allergies to papain, chymopapain, and bromelain. Papain is an enzyme derived from papaya extracts. Post isolation of immunoglobulin fragments from the ovine serum, papain is used to cleave them into fab and Fc portions. Trace amounts of activated or inactivated papain may still be present in the final product. This patient presents with the prototypical findings of digoxin overdose. The rapid development of wheezing, itching, and angioedema are indicative of developing an allergic reaction. Coupled with a history of allergy to papaya extracts, the most likely diagnosis is papain hypersensitivity. In such cases, DIF should only be administered if the benefits outweigh the risks. Other allergens such as dust mite and latex also have structural homology to antigenic structures within papain. Therefore, such cases may also carry a risk of developing allergic reactions upon DIF administration.",

    "explanation": "Ricin is a poisonous byproduct of castor oil production. It is watersoluble, odorless, tasteless, and stable under ambient conditions. Supportive management, along with decontamination, is the mainstay of treatment. Ricin hydrolyzes an N-glycosidic bond in the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. There is no known antidote. Symptoms include hallucinations, hematuria, hypotension, hypovolemic shock, and multiple system organ failures. Influenza-like symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and arthralgia may occur. Profuse diarrhea (bloody or non-bloody) and profuse vomiting often occur. Aflatoxin, a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus species, causes hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Cytochrome c oxidase inhibition is the mechanism of action of cyanide poisoning.
